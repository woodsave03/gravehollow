<br>Backstory
Decorated naval officer of the Cormyrian Empire's fleet. This was 200 years ago. Corporal Velmontaghe, lost at sea during the Year of Blue Fire, when the skies were sundered by storm and the Great Rain began. My vessel capsized, but there was too much to be attended to by the royal court for any name to be added to the list of the deceased. 
Now I am Sveng. I broke surface, escaping dark waters, to be met with an even darker sky. Everyone says the sun hasn't been out on a regular basis in centuries. I clung to buoyant wreckage until I encountered a ship in a storm. I clambered aboard, quickly hiding my figure under a coat I stole from a crewmember, then promptly pushed overboard. I cut my hair and wore a bandana to pass as masculine, afraid that the crew would cast me off out of superstitious belief.
These were pirates. I spent my past life hunting these bastards, and I did some things I still regret. I soon began rumors that there was a woman aboard, and sure enough word spread quickly, leading to suspicion among the ranks. I planted my undergarments in the captain's quarters when the others were busy throwing dice and navigating, and I began to bind with whatever cloth and bandages I could keep clean.
The pirates soon came to a point of intervention, and Captain Bulwrath was summoned to settle the dispute. Everyone soon came to the conclusion that none of them were the culprit, and so I piped up to challenge the captain's word. The others searched his quarters while we faced down, him enraged that I had the gall to challenge his word. He attacked and I defended myself, though he was skilled with a sabre. Not too long after the ring steel filled the deck, my short sword clattered to the side, leaving me only with a dagger.
At this point crewmates returned with my undergarments, having found them buried in dresser drawers that I was sure Bulwrath never even used. While he was distracted, I charged, grabbing him by the torso over the shoulder and his wrist in my right hand, twisting it and his sabre as I slammed him to the deck. I slipped his pistol out of its holster as I stood over him, his hands sprawled out to either side of his head, mouth agape in shock. The men standing beside me deemed his dishonesty to his crew strips him of his title, and I leveled the pistol towards his head. After a pregnant pause, I fired, to the left of his cheek, barely grazing his earlobe and the earrings he wore. I leaned over and took his hat from his head and placed it on my own, assuming command immediately to veer us to the nearest friendly port.
Of course, friendly to them meant something different to me, so I was met with an entire port town filled with miscreants of every flavor and ilk. I abandoned my crew, taking my belongings with me. I tried asking around at a tavern for passage to Cormyr, but they wouldn't talk until I bought a drink, and even then they weren't helpful. I drowned by troubles that night and eventually got kicked out for reasons that are too murky to recall.
Cast out on the streets, I traveled through streets by torchlight and staggered through alleyways. In one such alley I was met by a few suspicious-looking characters that blocked my way. Turning around I found two others walking my way. I was too intoxicated to defend myself, and the next day I woke up with the worst headache I've ever had, my gun, sabre, and boots missing, and only the gods know what why the rest of my clothes were in a state of undress, though I highly doubt it was anything pleasant.
I, Sulifyn Velmontaghe, have learned from those under the Code of the Fallen and have found honor within the system. I still hope to return to Cormyr to learn what came of the kingdom after the storms, and how I have returned.
<br>Physical Description<br><br>
<br>An action to loosen or tighten the binder
<br>-3 to checks regarding your disguise
<br>eliminates negative effects
<br>Disadvantage on athletics checks and constitution saving throws regarding physical exertion
<br>Time spent being able to hold your breath is halved.
<br>You cannot recover from exhaustion while binding
<br>Over-Wearing: If binding for more than 10 hours per long rest the following effects take place. The timer does not re-set until a long rest is taken while not binding.

<br>At 10 hours total: +1 level of exhaustion
<br>At 12 hours total:&nbsp; Suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage
<br>At 14 hours total: +1 level of exhaustion
<br>At 16 hours total: +1 level of exhaustion and suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage
<br>At 18 hours total: Suffer 2d6 bludgeoning damage
<br>At 20 hours total: Suffer 3d6 bludgeoning damage
<br>For every continued 2 hours still wearing the binder take an additional 4d6 bludgeoning damage


<br><br>Level 1: Land of the Living<br>Transformation Boons:<br>
Your time in death has given you resistance to poison and cold damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition. Maintaining a connection to the undead, you can telepathically communicate to any undead within 50 feet of you. Your body no longer requires sleep during a long rest, only needing an 8 hour period of light activity in order to recuperate.<br>Your ghastly visage gives you advantage on any Charisma(Intimidation) checks against creatures that are not un-dead. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead.<br>Transformation Impairment:<br>
Being so new to the land of the living, you can maintain nothing more but a loose grip on life. Your sickly pale skin, and emaciated body is offsetting to any that see you, there is something clearly unnatural with your form. You have disadvantage on any Charisma(Persuasion) checks with any creatures that are not un-dead. Your memory of life before death is fuzzy and vague, you have disadvantage on any Intelligence(History) checks regarding your previous life.<br>You ride the line between life and death and have disadvantage on death saving throws, and are considered undead when considering any spells or effects that affect undead creatures. Being undead, you share some of their weaknesses. Whenever you are dealt radiant damage, you must succeed a DC20 Constitution Saving Throw, or take double damage. Your body never truly dies but becomes a "Drowned Blade". Your soul is trapped within your mortal form, conscious and aware, but unable to control your actions.<br>Level 2: Death Defiant<br>Transformation Boons:<br>
You still reserve some powers from death giving you resistance to poison damage. Your body only requires 8 hours of light activity to gain the benefits of a long rest. If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point. You still look incredibly sickly and have advantage on Charisma(Intimidation) checks against creatures that are not un-dead.<br>Transformation Impairments:<br>
Your skin starts to gain some color, and your body gains some weight. But you still look incredibly sickly to most people you encounter, a trained eye can still recognize there is something unnatural about your life. You are still considered undead when any spells or effects that affect undead are active. Details of your past life are still murky and hazy giving you disadvantage on Intelligence(history) checks regarding your previous life. When taking radiant damage make a DC15 Constitution Saving throw or take double damage. Your body never truly dies but becomes a "Drowned Assassin". Your soul is trapped within your mortal form, conscious and aware, but unable to control your actions.<br>Level 3: Humane Again<br>Transformation Boons:<br>
Your body still maintains a resistance to poison damage, from your time in death. If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point. Your frame is no longer sickly thin, and most of the color has returned to your skin. You no longer appear as if you have come back from death.<br>Transformation Impairments:<br>
You still share some weaknesses of undead and must succeed a DC10 Constitution Saving throw or take double damage, when dealt radiant damage. You are still considered undead for the purpose of any spells or effects that affect undead. Your body never truly dies but becomes a "Drowned Master". Your soul is trapped within your mortal form, conscious and aware, but unable to control your actions.<br>Level 4: More Than Mortal<br>Transformation Boons:<br>
You are no longer just living, you have a solid grasp on life, and have become more than a mere mortal. You have kept a resistance to poison damage from your time of death. Your hold on life is so strong you have gained an advantage on death saving throws. If you roll a natural 20 on a death saving throw, your hit points increase to 1, and gain temporary HP equal to half your hit point total. You are able to sense any undead within 50 feet of you, and you understand their weak points and deal an extra 2d12 damage when attacking them.<br>You have become in tune with your past life and have advantage on ant Intelligence(History) checks regarding your past life. You age at half the pace that is normal for your race, and when the time comes that you should die, both your body and soul are able to pass away normally and find peace.]]></description><link>characters\dread\dread-pirates\pc's\sveng-carlisle.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Characters/Dread/Dread Pirates/PC's/Sveng Carlisle.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 20:57:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tyde Burl]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Backstory

Norwick’s grandparents were originally from the spine of the world. After the dread they were forced to seek refuge in Luskan. When his parents were children aberration invasions forced them to escape further south to Neverwinter where it was a much nicer and safer place to live. As a child their parents would take them up along the Neverwinter River, sparking this interest within him to go out and explore outside the city. Much of their time as a kid was spent researching the Sword’s coast and other far away lands, and all the various things they would have to know in order to go out and explore beyond. 

Norwick joined the Neverwinter Rifle Corps almost as soon as they were able, craving&nbsp; adventure and a chance to get out of the protected walls of the city of Neverwinter and explore the lands beyond. Norwick took his job seriously, as it provided him a chance to get outside the city and took great care in learning to properly use and care for his weapon. Norwick however, is aware of the scarcity and rarity of ammunition outside of the supply of the rifle corps, so he chose to also train in martial and simple weapons. Always keeping its great ax, a javelin, and two hand axes with it along with the standard issue musket, in order to be prepared for any situation. 
During a hunting excursion in the Neverwinter woods, searching for any demons or undead. While in the woods Norwick lost his temper in the midst of a small encounter, triggering the first appearance of his much more violent alter ego. Norwick lost control of his own mind and body, he not only defeated the monster they were facing, but almost their entire party was massacred. 
The only other survivor of his party found Norwick lying in the brush, dazed and his uniform in tatters. Norwick himself had retained very little memory of the actions they performed while in their rage. This continues to happen to Norwick anytime he is sent on an excursion into the woods. As these attacks have become more common, word has spread throughout the rifle corps about a monster in the woods that they are deemed incapable of stopping, and the city has hired mercenaries to try and defeat it. 

Norwick has continued to think and look back at his recent times spent in the Neverwinter Woods, and how he always seems to survive these freak encounters with no memory as to what happened. Looking and thinking back into these lost moments in time, in combination with more frequently occurring (though less aggressive) moments of anger where they can almost feel themselves growing stronger, body growing, vision going blurry; until he takes a deep breath and calms his emotions, and his its body returns to a normal state. Sometimes losing track of time only to wake up finding his own living quarters in shambles. The possibility has begun to grow in Norwick's mind that it was his fault that his hunting parties continue to never return home, not some beast that roams throughout the Neverwinter Woods.&nbsp; Ever since this revelation Norwick has mainly tried to keep his head down, avoiding any extra attention, or questions as to what he knows about that hunt in the woods. Even separating himself from his monstrous side, and not feeling a connection with those actions. Any spare time he has outside of his rifle corps duties is mainly spent researching what could be the cause of his outbursts.
<br>Physical Description

Tall 7'10" bugbear, standing very straight and at attention, towering over almost everyone around him. Their golden brown eyes almost always scanning the area for danger or a potential threat. Their eyes darting back and forth, nose sniffing for any scents that are out of the ordinary. Ears twitching at the smallest of noises. He has a thick protective bright orange undershirt, with a black over shirt pulled overtop. It seems to be very tightly fit on his very large frame. He has a fur shawl draped over his back and across their shoulders. An orange cloth belt is tied around his waste, with black pants that fit much looser around his long legs. The bottoms being held into place by wraps instead of boots like the rest of the Rifle Corps, these wraps are also tightly wound around his feet providing some more protection. The balmoral bonnet worn by most Rifle Corps members its pulled tightly over the top of his head, pushing his ears down. It wears leather arm guards, along with leather straps across his chest keeping his javelin, musket and his great axe tightly strapped to his back. Two hand axes are tied to his belt where he can easily access in case of emergency. 

When in a rage they grow to about 8 feet tall, muscles rippling as they hunch over. His limbs growing to odd disproportionate lengths, causing him to lumber around. As his body and muscles grow, it begins to tear apart the shirt of his uniform leaving it in tatters. The wraps around his legs begin to pull apart exposing more of the fur underneath. The fur on his body becomes incredibly patchy as slimy sinewy muscles becomes exposed as he grows. His golden brown eyes narrow filling with rage, losing any kind of recognition when you look into their eyes. Its fangs growing large and jutting out of his mouth.

To this day, his kingdom still stands, the royal family still lords over the land, and his court is filled with draconian races and bird folk decent from the original party to cross the sea. The small folk are primarily made up of awakened beings. (except for bird folk, because they remind him of his wife who dies escaping :(, they get to chill with the nobles )

<br>Backstory
Ellwick has been living in Alaron for several decades, going by the alias of Eli Fenson. He remains hard at work in his own workshop, producing technology from his home to be shipped to Mirabar and sequentially sold to Neverwinter. He has been the sole supplier of the Neverwinter Rifle Corps, as the only craftsman familiar with the trade of gunsmithing and black powder. He keeps the chemical formulas and blueprints of his craft secret, as he knows the dire consequences of such knowledge becoming uncontrolled.
<br>Physical Description
Ellwick has soft, boyish features, not particularly thin, nor plump, nor muscular. No prominence of chin, nose, or cheekbones to be heard of. He has his own way of standing out from others, besides the matter of his pointed ears. A shock of red hair that gleams in the light of his clockwork torchbugs is kept to a short trim, to keep it from hindering his craft, an unkempt and unruly mess that stands up in every which way. Freckles spread across his small, round nose and cheeks.<br>
After a freak accident, Ellwick's eyes are now off-putting shining turquoise crystals, no pupils or irises to be seen, simply continuous color. One of these lights starts to flicker, and his head cocks to the side, meeting with his hand as nimble fingers adjust the rotation and tap its surface, returning its glimmer in moments. These dexterous hands however are covered in wiring, almost creating a metallic exoskeleton, lining over where tendons stretch and piercing into the joints with various needles and straps.<br>
When he speaks it sounds raspy, and coiled strings vibrate around their neck, held just off the skin in concentric circles fit onto metal bars piercing through his neck and into his skull. When he speaks the vibrations are preceded by electric blue sparks traveling along the strings, spiraling around his neck and humming in reverb.<br>
He’s wearing a dark leather trench coat, the sleeves rolled up revealing a layer of a sun-faded tunic sleeves and his forearms where what looks to be a symbol is branded into his small, pale wrist. The coat drapes down to the ground as he’s crouched down, a small notebook laid across his knees as he carefully pens something with fluid quill-strokes.&nbsp;He looks up at your arrival, quickly rising to his feet, but his originally small stature remains so at 3'4" as he reaches full height. The trench coat now reaches his lower thigh, resting over grey trousers, tucked inside leather boots, which reach to his upper calf. The collar of his coat reaches up towards his chin, a leather pauldron sitting next to it on his right shoulder, studded with iron reinforcement, held in place by a leather strap which crosses over his toughened leather breastplate and hooks onto his belt. Another leather strap attached to the right side of his belt crosses over to fasten the left side of his coat, where a brass timepiece is harnessed. He closes his notebook and slides it into a hidden pocket on the inside of his coat, placing his quill in one of the two small pouches latched onto the front his belt, and you can see what seems to be two coin purses as well, tied to belt loops on either side of his hips. He loops his thumb through the left strap of his backpack, adjusting his goggles, which has both a crystal lens and a metal covering with many bored holes. Immediately afterwards he smiles and waves at you, the three glowing, mechanical torchbugs casting a shadow of his hand over you.

<br>Sometimes performs beyond to the migratory barbarian tribes outside of Ten Towns, as well as some dwarven strongholds in the Spine of the World. From Luskan to Mithral Hall, Mynksie is well-known in the north.

<br>Backstory
There is a reason to this jester's mystery, as they do not have a known origin. they do not come from a king's court, nor have they performed in circus of a lord's company. They have not learned juggling from traveling with minstrels or picked up their inspiration from roaming bards-for-hire. Behind their singular smile lies a tale untold, and that will remain so, as unchanging as the frozen expression they wear in the icy tundra they roam.<br>
Mynksie, as people have come to know them, is, truly, a wind spirit. they flaunt their magics as entertainment, and live for the emotions they can bring to the children in their audience. The one who was Mynskie is long gone, but their presence remains in Icewind Dale, for they were boisterous and bull-headed in their past life, challenging a visiting minstrel to a duel of wonder and awe. What they did not know, was that this minstrel was a visiting faerie, and their deal was binding.<br>
They put their fame on the line, their pride and their name. Were either party to win, they would win these treasures from the other, and may their charm decide the better.<br>
They lost the game, and with it their name, and everyone forgot the Ten Towns' Tumbler. Their performances became that of yore, now tied to the fey's fame. their pact came into fruition through a binding to Mynksie's craft, they had unfinished business, to spread cheer and emotion across the north, but could never tell the story of the nameless bard.<br>
Now this was long ago, and since their fall from fame, they have begun to make a name for themself once more. Centuries of commitment to their art has consumed them, changed them, into a shadow of what they once were. A wind spirit, an agent of tumultuous reaction, the tempest in the heart of all things, whose calling is to bring forth the emotions hidden away in people, tearing down walls and leaving souls windswept and raw, and therefore truest as could be.<br>
They do not show their visage for they no longer have one. They are a pure force of presence, the one who was the Ten Towns' Tumbler, the nameless bard, is no more. Not dead, per se, but transformed, and forgotten. What is left behind is a performer even more mystical, moving like the wind and vaulting across the stage as if the very air carried them along, embodying the winds of time as they sang stories familiar and odd. Word of mouth is their trade, and acrobatics their medium. Just be wary of their wrath, for their sword is as swift as their tongue.
<br>Physical Description
Covered in court motley, patchwork in rich forest greens and cinnamon reds, and a billowing cloak of midnight blue. Silver bells adorning the corners and cuffs of fabric, jingling with each turn of the wrist, patter of the foot, flick of the cape and toss of the head, atop of which lies a three-pointed fool's hat, sitting just above the porcelain white static face of a grinning jester.<br>
Covered from head to toe in festive garb, clashing patterns and bold embroidery, one cannot see an inch of skin, gloves covered in silver stars hide their hands and purple ombre hood of their cloak conceals their neck while it rests on their shoulders.

 <br>Race: N/A<br>
Class: N/A<br>
Occupation: N/A<br>
Pronouns: N/A<br>
Birthday: N/A<br>
Age: N/A<br>Relations

The Crimson Lanterns – Marciel despises them as agents of unchecked vice and chaos. He has personally sanctioned purges against their dens.<br>
The Gilded Tribunal – Though allies in faith, some within the Tribunal fear Marciel’s unchecked power. A faction within seeks to replace him with a more “manageable” Inquisitor.<br>
The Forge Collective – Their smuggling of arcane materials into Hellhaven is an unforgivable transgression. Marciel has agents actively hunting their network.<br>
The Whispered Rebellion – A secret movement within the Vault itself, prisoners and rogue scholars plotting against him. Though he is aware of them, he allows them to exist—for now.
<br>Info


<br>The Lord’s Will is Absolute – There is no room for interpretation; there is only obedience or sin.
<br>Heresy is Contagious – The moment one soul strays, others will follow. Root it out. Burn it away. Do not hesitate.
<br>Pain is Purification – The body is weak, the mind is treacherous, but suffering brings clarity.
<br>Magic is a Tool, Not a Right – He does not fear magic, nor reject it outright. Instead, he believes it must be shackled, controlled, and wielded only by those proven worthy.
<br>Hellhaven Must Endure – The city is a fragile balance of divine order and human defiance. Marciel sees himself as the only thing keeping it from collapsing into chaos.

<br>Background

<br>Master of <a data-href="The Vault of Penance" href="locations\landmarks\establishments\the-vault-of-penance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Vault of Penance</a>: Every prisoner, artifact, and secret in the Vault is under his authority.
<br>Architect of Public Fear: He ensures that rumors of the Vault’s horrors spread, discouraging rebellion.
<br>Judge, Jury, and Executioner: Those who defy the church rarely live to tell the tale.
<br>Advisor to the Lord’s High Clergy: While not the supreme leader of Hellhaven’s theocracy, his influence is undeniable—even the Archprelates tread carefully around him.

<br>Physical Description &amp; Personality


<br>Age: Mid-50s, though he carries himself as if untouched by time.
<br>Height: 6’4” (193 cm), looming over most who stand before him.
<br>Build: Lean but powerful, his frame wrapped in ceremonial robes reinforced with hidden armor.
<br>Eyes: A cold, faded gold, as though the divine light within him has burned away any trace of warmth.
<br>Hair: Short, silvery-white, always immaculate.
<br>Complexion: Pale and severe, his skin marked by faint glyph-scars, remnants of sanctified rituals that have allegedly hardened his soul against corruption.
<br>Distinguishing Features:

<br>His left arm is wrapped in consecrated chains, each link inscribed with holy scripture, a sign of his sworn pact with <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>.
<br>The scent of incense and burning parchment clings to him, as if the air itself recognizes him as a purifier of heresy.





<br>Unshakable: Rhaeven does not doubt. He is the executioner of faith, immune to moral hesitation.
<br>Methodical: Every action he takes is deliberate, every decision calculated for maximum effectiveness.
<br>Charismatic in a Terrifying Way: He speaks with the unwavering conviction of a prophet, making even his enemies question their own beliefs.
<br>Sadistically Righteous: He does not revel in cruelty for its own sake, but he firmly believes suffering brings repentance, and he ensures that no heretic dies without first begging for absolution.
<br>Intelligent and Cunning: Unlike many blunt instruments of the faith, Marciel is a strategist. He understands that brute force alone cannot hold Hellhaven together—fear and control are far more effective tools.

<br>Interaction Hook

<br>The Chains of the Inquisitor: Marciel’s consecrated chains hold a dark secret—they were reforged from the bindings of a forgotten god, and something within them still whispers.
<br>The Failed Purge: A recent raid on a heretic cell went wrong—not a single <a data-href="Creosmagi" href="organizations\creosmagi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Creosmagi</a> returned. Marciel is personally overseeing the next hunt.
<br>The Hidden Journal: Someone has unearthed writings from Marciel’s past, suggesting that once, long ago, he was not the zealot he is today. If this knowledge spreads, it could shatter his iron image.
<br>The Living Relic: Deep within the Vault, a prisoner unlike any other is held—a being from before <a data-href="the Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the Lord</a>’s arrival. Marciel visits it frequently, but no one knows why.

 <br>
Two spheres collide in the realmspace starscape, merging and creating a new existence, a new reality. A cataclysm on an astral scale whose consequences are unfelt by the consciousnesses that reside within the storm's eye. Those who exist outside of the convergence are the only beings who can witness the grandeur of its impact.

When Umbrea and the Forgotten Realms were pulled together by an interdimensional rift in the Blue Veil, the planes' individual connections to the Outer Realms were disjointed temporarily. Any spirits unattached from the Material Plane whose journeys to the Fugue Plane were incomplete, they were ejected from the merging spheres, shunted and shattered, scattered to the cosmos and untethered from physical form.
Some souls found an anchor in physical vessels, some drift through the stars infinitely, some cross into the Far Realm and become something more, something other. And some, return home, only to find it drastically altered from their known reality.

<br>Renee Description: A large room in the shape of an octagon lies unassuming. Two staircases rise from either side of the entrance, leading to an overlooking balcony. There are torches on the walls burning an everlasting light, the green flames flickering as though alive themselves. Paintings line both levels, works of art displaying haughty and arrogant folks. A man with a long, twisted moustache smokes a cigar as he dully looks forward (Thomas Halifact). To his right is a woman with long blonde hair, smiling pointlessly forward, seeing past and maybe beyond (Sarah Halifact).  A few tables lay about along with a dusty old piano situated solemnly against the rightmost wall and the leftmost wall is covered by a bookshelf.

<br>The bookshelf can be moved, revealing the entrance to the catacombs.
<br>Behind one of the paintings is a phrase "Where the sun doesn't shine but the moon is bright, I see only grey as I run out of time."

 <br>A showdown for the ages. The garden is much more alive than the one outside the mansion. The hag awaits there. The battle can go one of many ways.<br>
1. Everyone turns on each other because of the deals set up (if gone down that path). The hag will watch in delighted amusement with her rat friends, eating a bucket of eyeballs like popcorn and throwing out quips or weird suggestions.<br>
2. Everyone fights against the hag.<br>
3. You can “save” the hag through persuasion checks. By revealing the past of Annabelle, you are able to make persuasion checks and bring back the hag’s memories and restore her humanity. The amount of successful checks is up to the dm. However, if the players get 3 rolls 5 and under, the hag will unleash The Entity.<br>
4. The party splits, those that break their pact suffer the consequences and the ones who adhere to it will be respected by the owner of the Manor, who may even help in the fight.<br>An area within the <a data-href="Dealing Manor" href="locations\landmarks\establishments\dealing-manor\dealing-manor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dealing Manor</a>.

- Some mending spells would reveal that it is family paintings, with the man and woman from the foyer paintings holding a small baby.<br>
- In the desk, one would find a letter in an envelope, the edges burnt. The letter reads, “I appreciate hearing from you, Mykahni. It’s been two months since Wynrose died, and Sarah is not improving.

 <br>Location and Description<br>Notable Residents<br>History and Lore

Scornubel, Thomas Buckenbridge asks Agatha for a son, Saliba Weistan is born on the 15th of Kythorn

Ashnei Darkwind, Astera Glasciasare, <a data-href="Daewynn Hithglad" href="characters\dread\mini-games\dealing-manor\daewynn-hithglad.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Daewynn Hithglad</a>, Evanescence of Waterdeep, &amp; Venarious Sullac seek out the power of the hag for various reasons. The first three made a pact to betray the others and their wish was promised to be granted if they were the last standing. Evanescence and Ashnei broke their pact with Agatha, Evanescence and Venarious were slain by Daewynn, who was slain shortly after by Ashnei and his own folly. 

Venarious and Daewynn were resurrected by Agatha, and begins to honor her pact with Daewynn, granting fae power and training in arcane necromancy. Agatha grows changelings in the cellar, and abducts a child in Beregost named Annabelle. 

Agatha works for REDACTED, the reason why she spreads suffering wherever she goes through her deals. Daewynn has begun to realize that they have exhausted the hag's knowledge and began to work behind her back to overthrow her position in the pact with REDACTED. After contacting REDACTED through Agatha's ritual, he killed Agatha and sealed the pact with her essence. REDACTED leads him to transport the Manor to Gwynneth and begin summoning dark fey to assault Sarifal.<br>
Daewynn used his infiltrating fey to spread rumors about a hag named Annabelle that lived in a certain "Dealing Manor" where the fey originated from. Maybe it's actually what the summoned fey believe. It's a slow war, one of espionage and intrigue, and will last many years.

Prince Araithe of Sarifal goes on a scourge through the Winterglen, striking down any resistance that he encounters. REDACTED leads Daewynn to temporarily transport the Manor to the Neverwinter Forest to assist a Nothic in summoning and binding an Alkilith to the trellis entrance to Varienne's cottage.<br>
During this time, REDACTED approaches Dealing Manor in search of someone to help him soil the REDACTED family name, so Daewynn, not having any time to teach him anything, teleports him to REDACTED's tower in the Underdark, much to REDACTED's chagrin. .... REDACTED ...

Daewynn returns the Dealing Manor to Winterglen and continues fulfilling their pact with REDACTED by building a dark fae army in response to Prince Araithe's and the Keepers of the Fractured Ruby's boldness. Establishing a permanent feycrossing by contaminating a REDACTED with REDACTED's magic.

Events of the Dealing Manor sidequest occur.

<br>Location: Beneath the central cathedral of Hellhaven, with entrances heavily guarded by the <a data-href="Creosmagi" href="organizations\creosmagi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Creosmagi</a>.
<br>Structure: A labyrinthine, multi-tiered vault descending deep into the earth, each level serving a distinct function.
<br>Purpose:

<br>Imprisonment – Holding heretics, dissidents, and rogue mages.
<br>Artifact Containment – Storing and studying arcane relics too dangerous for public knowledge.
<br>Repentance &amp; Trial – Torture chambers, confession halls, and execution sites for those deemed irredeemable.
<br>Buried Depths – Sealed chambers that predate <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>’s rule, containing forgotten history, horrors, and mysteries.



<br>Lore
The Vault of Penance is a vast subterranean complex beneath Hellhaven, serving as both a prison and a sanctified repository for arcane artifacts deemed heretical by the clergy. It is where the <a data-href="Creosmagi" href="organizations\creosmagi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Creosmagi</a> incarcerates those accused of sorcery, blasphemy, or defiance against <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Hellhapfen Governance and Power > ^abc6e7" data-href="Hellhapfen Governance and Power#^abc6e7" href="locations\settlements\haven-of-hale\subpages\hellhapfen-governance-and-power.html#^abc6e7" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Creed of Binding Light</a>. It is also a site of secretive research, as scholars of the church attempt to repurpose dangerous relics for the theocracy’s benefit. The deeper levels, abandoned to the ages, are rumored to hold ancient pre-theocratic ruins, long-forgotten heresies, and prisoners who have been erased from history.
<br>Current Events<br><br><br>
<br>The Vault of Penance is the jurisdiction of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Hellhapfen Governance and Power > **The Seven Archprelates" data-href="Hellhapfen Governance and Power#**The Seven Archprelates" href="locations\settlements\haven-of-hale\subpages\hellhapfen-governance-and-power.html#**The_Seven_Archprelates" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Archprelate of Binds</a> <a data-href="Rhaeven Marciel" href="characters\hellhaven\rhaeven-marciel.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Rhaeven Marciel</a>, a zealous enforcer of divine law.
<br>Prisoners undergo brutal interrogations, with forced confessions being a common outcome.
<br>Some inmates are released as broken converts, while others are executed or simply vanish into the lower depths.
<br><br>
<br>The church hoards magical artifacts in the vaults, seeking to either purify or repurpose them.
<br>Many items are unstable, their power restrained by wards and sigils.
<br>Certain factions within the clergy argue over the ethics of wielding such relics rather than destroying them.
<br><br>
<br>The lower levels contain remnants of Gellhafn’s past, sealed away after <a data-href="The Dread" href="lore\time\major-events\the-dread.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Dread</a>.
<br>It is rumored that something old and unsanctioned stirs in the depths, beyond even the Inquisition’s reach.
<br>The deepest chambers are uncharted, lost to time, superstition, and the deaths of those who dared to explore.
<br><br>
<br>Some imprisoned mages and scholars work in secret to escape or overthrow their captors.
<br>Smugglers and rogue clerics leak information from within, offering a glimpse into the church’s darkest secrets.
<br>The Vault may be more than just a prison—it could be a ticking time bomb of suppressed knowledge and rising dissent.

 <br><br>Empir Draconi was born from the unity of warring states upon a vast island kingdom, an expanse of fertile land and volcanic peaks surrounded by the temperamental sea. The empire’s heart lay in the capital, a city of towering basalt citadels and grand avenues paved with polished obsidian. From this center of power, emperors and the Magisterium ruled with calculated authority, their dominion stretching outward through fortified ports, sprawling agricultural terraces, and mining colonies rich with precious ores.<br><br>While the floating cities became the pride of the empire, the land itself remained its foundation. The empire's mainland domains, including its annexed territories and coastal fortresses, provided the resources necessary for its continued expansion. The grand roads, paved with arcane-reinforced stone, connected its provinces, ensuring the swift movement of legions, goods, and imperial decrees. These regions were governed by high lords and imperial magistrates, maintaining order and enforcing the will of the emperor.<br><br>Empir Draconi’s dominion was vast, divided into distinct regions, each serving a crucial role:<br>
<br>The Imperial Heartland – The ruling seat of the empire, housing the Magisterium, the emperor’s palace, and the grand arenas of law and war.<br>

<br>The Celestial Bastions – The floating cities, each a self-sufficient entity hosting scholars, military garrisons, and the elite of society.<br>

<br>The Dock-Cities – The fortified mountain settlements that managed commerce and passage between the sky and the land.<br>

<br>The Outer Provinces – The agricultural and mining regions, sustaining the empire’s economy and supplying its war machine.<br>

<br>The Border Forts – Strongholds that marked the limits of the empire, guarding against both foreign invaders and internal dissent.
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Sky-Galleons – Vast airships that connected floating cities to the land, powered by arcane propulsion.<br>

<br>Imperial Roads – Enchanted highways that allowed swift and efficient movement between the empire’s key holdings.<br>

<br>Drake-Carriages – Beasts of burden bred for speed and endurance, serving nobility and military officers alike.
<br><br>Imperial decree strictly controlled access to its floating cities. Entry required sanctioned writs, granted only to merchants, scholars, and officials. The dock-cities managed trade and migration, ensuring that only those deemed worthy ascended to the skies.<br><br>
<br>The Gilded Arch – The grand entrance to the imperial capital, a gate of obsidian and gold, guarded by elite sentinels.<br>

<br>The Azure Gateways – The enchanted portals that linked the floating cities, accessible only by those who held the emperor’s favor.<br>

<br>The Iron Watch – The heavily fortified border gates, defending the empire’s most vulnerable frontiers.
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Aetherstone – The foundation of the floating cities, an arcane mineral infused with levitational properties.<br>

<br>Blacksteel and Obsidian – The primary materials of imperial construction, resilient and imposing.<br>

<br>Glasscrete – A fusion of volcanic sand and enchanted binding agents, forming the empire’s transparent yet unyielding structures.
<br><br>The mastery of Empir Draconi’s arcanists and engineers saw the birth of an age of unparalleled innovation. In the later centuries of the Gnosichron Era, the empire undertook its most ambitious endeavor: the separation of mountaintops from their earthly roots, shaping them into great floating cities sustained by aetherstone and tethered to the arcane fabric of the world. These airborne bastions did not replace the island kingdom but instead served as mobile strongholds, centers of governance, and testaments to the empire’s command over both magic and nature. Below them, dock-cities emerged at the severed peaks, vital trade hubs linking the heavens and the land.<br><br>
<br>The Magisterium Spire – The seat of arcane governance, where scholars and artificers dictated the advancement of magical sciences.<br>

<br><a data-href="The Sunforged Coliseum" href="locations\settlements\draconic-empire\establishments\the-sunforged-coliseum.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Sunforged Coliseum</a> – A grand arena where warriors proved their worth before the emperor’s gaze.<br>

<br>The Riftvault Archives – A subterranean vault containing ancient knowledge, accessible only to the empire’s most trusted minds.
<br><br><br>Beneath the empire’s cities and fortresses, the land thrived under careful cultivation and arcane augmentation:<br>
<br>A temperate climate, stabilized through controlled weather manipulation.<br>

<br>Seismic activity harnessed for geothermal energy and volcanic glass production.
<br><br>Flora

<br>Aetherbloom – A luminous flower cultivated for its arcane-conductive properties.<br>

<br>Obsidian Vines – Hardy plants used in the reinforcement of imperial walls and terraces.<br>


<br>Fauna

<br>Drakebeasts – Domesticated wyvern-like creatures serving as the empire’s primary aerial mounts.<br>

<br>Ember Stags – Flame-touched cervids revered as omens of imperial favor.<br>


<br>Pests

<br>Void Moths – Insects that consume residual arcane energy, weakening enchantments over time.<br>

<br>Burrow Leeches – Subterranean parasites that infest the lower districts and outer provinces.

 <br><br>Empir Draconi stood as a bastion of power, yet it was not without its dangers. The empire’s survival relied on an intricate network of defenses, both mundane and arcane. To guard against external forces and internal subversion, the Magisterium commissioned legions of warding glyphs and arcane surveillance systems. Enchanted fortifications ensured that even the floating cities were protected from siege, with arcane storms conjured to repel aerial assaults.<br>The empire faced threats beyond mortal warfare—fabric rifts, incursions of eldritch entities, and rogue sorcery tested its resilience. The Warden of <a data-href="the Fabric" href="entities-&amp;-phenomena\the-fabric.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the Fabric</a>, an imperial office charged with maintaining stability between the Material and Astral planes, was pivotal in preventing such disasters. Specialized orders, such as the Riftwardens and the Ashen Pact, were established to combat existential threats.<br>Natural disasters were no less perilous. The empire's island heartland was prone to tremors and seaquakes, leading to extensive research in seismic mitigation. Floating cities were engineered not merely for expansion, but as a safeguard against these cataclysms, ensuring that the ruling elite could govern unscathed even if the land below suffered.<br><br><br>Magic was the lifeblood of Empir Draconi, interwoven into its culture, industry, and warfare. The empire’s architects employed geomancy and elemental binding to construct and sustain its great cities. Roads pulsed with leyline energy, ensuring swift travel, while archaic golems carried out labor alongside mortal craftsmen.<br>The state maintained strict oversight of arcane practice, with the Magisterium regulating the use of leyline tapping and to what extent. The Weaversworn, a prestigious sect of spellcasters, were entrusted with grand arcane endeavors, from stabilizing the floating metropolises to imbuing imperial relics with untold power. Meanwhile, the Wyrmforged—mage-smiths of unparalleled skill—crafted living metal constructs, automated sentinels that patrolled the empire's borders.<br>Even daily life bore the mark of magic. Farmers called upon weatherbinders to ensure bountiful harvests, while healers infused their remedies with restorative enchantments. Those of noble blood often bore sigils of protection, their ancestral lines marked by contracts with spirits or celestial patrons.<br><br><br>The empire was deeply spiritual, its doctrine a fusion of ancestor veneration and celestial worship. The Weaver, an enigmatic cosmic entity believed to shape fate itself, was revered above all. Temples of the Grand Loom stood as places of worship and divination, where oracles deciphered the threads of destiny.<br>Imperial cults flourished, dedicated to revered emperors who had ascended beyond mortality. Pilgrims sought blessings at the tombs of past rulers, believing that their spirits guided the empire from beyond the veil. In contrast, the Riftborne—esoteric sects that communed with the chaotic forces beyond <a data-href="the Fabric" href="entities-&amp;-phenomena\the-fabric.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the Fabric</a>—were viewed with suspicion, their practices teetering on the edge of heresy.<br><br>
<br>Aeternis Reckoning – The new year’s celebration, marking the passage of another cycle within the empire’s grand chronicle. Rituals of renewal were performed, and the emperor’s decree for the coming year was unveiled.<br>

<br>The Celestial Weave – A holy festival honoring the divine tapestry of fate. Oracles presented prophecies, and citizens wove symbolic threads into grand murals representing their aspirations.<br>

<br>Titanfall Remembrance – A solemn day of reverence for the empire’s victories over the primordial giants in the Titanfall Conflict. Military parades and historical reenactments honored the legacy of those who fought.<br>

<br>The Night of Shattered Veils – A time of caution, marking the anniversary of a near-catastrophic planar breach. Protective wards were reinforced, and offerings were made to the Warden of <a data-href="the Fabric" href="entities-&amp;-phenomena\the-fabric.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the Fabric</a> to maintain balance between realms.

<br><br>
<br>Xiranthessar (Floating) – A stronghold of the empire’s military elite, Xiranthessar functioned as a mobile command center, allowing rapid deployment of imperial forces. Its sky-docks were lined with drake-rider garrisons and warforged constructs, ready for battle at a moment’s notice.
<br>Xirandral (Docking) – A rugged outpost carved into the cliffs below, Xirandral was a recruitment hub, prison complex, and proving ground for warriors. Its infamous gladiatorial pits tested potential conscripts in brutal combat trials.
<br><br>
<br>Zevorithessar (Floating) – The heart of commerce and trade, Zevorithessar’s shimmering marketplaces were famed across the empire, dealing in rare goods, magical artifacts, and luxury wares. Merchant princes wielded immense influence here, competing for imperial favor.
<br>Zevoridral (Docking) – A heavily defended checkpoint ensuring only authorized traders could access Zevorithessar. It was also a haven for spies and clandestine dealings, as ambitious merchants often sought to undercut rivals through underhanded means.
<br><br>

 <br><br>Empir Draconi boasted a rich linguistic tradition, with Draconic serving as the official language of governance, magic, and high culture. However, regional dialects and influences from trade partners and vassal states contributed to a diverse linguistic landscape.<br><br>
<br>High Draconic – The formal dialect spoken by the ruling elite, scholars, and magisters. This version was infused with arcane phrasing and complex grammatical structures.
<br>Imperial Common – The lingua franca of the empire, derived from Draconic but simplified for ease of use among traders, artisans, and commoners.
<br>Dockside Creole – A blend of Imperial Common, regional tongues, and foreign influences, spoken in trade hubs and docking settlements.
<br>Deep Cant – The dialect of those who fled to the Kagecombs, heavily influenced by underground survivalist slang and cryptic phrasing meant to conceal meaning from outsiders.
<br><br><br>The expansion of floating cities and subterranean enclaves influenced every aspect of Empir Draconi’s social structure. The wealthy and powerful resided in elevated cities, looking down—both literally and figuratively—on those in the docking settlements below. Meanwhile, the island kingdom, which served as the heart of the empire, became a highly stratified society where proximity to the emperor often dictated political influence.<br>With the fall of the empire, the survivors’ adaptations led to further divergence in culture and daily life. Those in the wastes maintained vestiges of imperial grandeur, while the Kagecombs’ denizens developed a pragmatic and secretive society, valuing adaptability and communal survival over status and tradition.<br><br><br><br>
<br>Skyborne Feasts – Lavish meals consisting of rare meats, exotic fruits, and spiced wines, reserved for the floating city elites.
<br>Seafarer’s Fare – Fresh seafood, preserved kelp, and fermented delicacies were staples for those on the island kingdom before its sinking.
<br>Dockside Stews – Hearty meals made from accessible ingredients like root vegetables, dried meats, and sea salt.
<br>Wasteland Rations – In the post-collapse world, foragers rely on roasted drakegrass, ember vine fruit, and smoked storm drake meat.
<br>Kagecombs Brews – Distilled from underground fungi and bioluminescent algae, these potent drinks are both nourishment and ritual offering.
<br><br>Wealth disparity in Empir Draconi was pronounced. The aristocracy resided in floating palaces of aetherstone, removed from the struggles of common laborers. The merchant class, while influential, still relied on imperial favor to maintain their status. Below them, dock workers, farmers, and artisans lived under strict economic hierarchies. Following the empire’s fall, the survivors saw a forced equalization—those who retained knowledge of imperial technology or arcane secrets held an advantage, while former elites struggled to adjust to the new world order.<br><br>Empir Draconi maintained a wary stance toward outsiders, balancing diplomacy with displays of strength.<br>
<br>Allied Traders – Merchant guilds from neighboring regions were permitted controlled access to docking settlements but rarely allowed into floating cities.
<br>Vassal Tribes – Some indigenous peoples were assimilated into the empire, while others resisted, leading to ongoing conflicts.
<br>Arcane Scholars – Foreign mages sought entry to study the empire’s advances in magic, though few were granted permission without proving loyalty.
<br>Post-Fall Relations – In the wake of the empire’s collapse, survivors in the wastes and Kagecombs remain suspicious of newcomers, viewing them as potential threats or resources to exploit.

 <br><br>
<br>Front: A reputable tinkering and repair shop specializing in ship components, automaton parts, and fine clockwork mechanisms. The sign outside reads:<br>
“Brighton’s Fix &amp; Fiddle – Precision Repairs &amp; Custom Craftwork.”
<br>Overview

<br>Location: Nestled in a dimly lit alley of the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Hellhapfen Geography and Layout > **Chainmoor Brine Yards** _(Docks &amp; Industrial Shipping)_" data-href="Hellhapfen Geography and Layout#**Chainmoor Brine Yards** _(Docks &amp; Industrial Shipping)_" href="locations\settlements\haven-of-hale\subpages\hellhapfen-geography-and-layout.html#**Chainmoor_Brine_Yards**__(Docks_&amp;_Industrial_Shipping)_" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chainmoor Brine Yards</a>, squeezed between a rotting sailmaker’s loft and a derelict spice warehouse. The constant clatter of gears and hissing steam conceal hushed conversations.
<br>Access: Customers seeking more than mechanical repairs must use the coded phrase: “I need a tune-up for my arcane conductor.”—only then will Brighton lead them into the hidden chamber below the shop.
<br>Hidden Chamber: A vaulted, sea-sprayed cavern beneath the shop, where arcane trinkets float weightlessly in lantern-lit glass cases. Some items still hum with residual magic, while others seem eager to be held.

<br>NPCs

Brighton, an Archfey warlock with an unsettling grin, runs the shop. Always impeccably dressed, with clockwork jewelry that shifts on its own, he speaks in riddles and deflects questions with humor. Those who cross him tend to vanish into the dark tides of the Chainmoor.
<br>History and Lore

<br>True Business: A black-market magic emporium dealing in stolen and cursed magical items, often plundered from merchant caravans.

These tokens are:<br>
<br>Forged from <a data-href="petrolune" href="lore\mechanics\petrolune.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">petrolune</a>, infused with a drop of the bearer’s blood, and soul-bound upon activation.

 <br><br><br>Hellhaven is a meticulously planned city, structured around strict principles of order and efficiency dictated by <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>’s adjudicators.

<br><br>(Docks &amp; Industrial Shipping)<br>
<br>A vast shipyard, famed for producing steam-powered vessels using <a data-href="Vergrenzig" href="locations\settlements\to-be-fleshed\vergrenzig.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vergrenzig</a>-imported innovations. The district is dense with warehouses, repair docks, and smuggling rings hiding within the labyrinthine canals.
<br><br>(Tinker’s &amp; Artificer’s Quarter)<br>
<br>A newer district, filled with mechanists, artificers, and alchemists, many of whom are immigrants from <a data-href="Vergrenzig" href="locations\settlements\to-be-fleshed\vergrenzig.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vergrenzig</a>. Gas-lit signs flicker above shopfronts, advertising arcane-electric engines, clockwork contraptions, and mechanized limbs.

<br>A fortified garrison, where the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Hellhapfen Governance and Power > ^c5ef99" data-href="Hellhapfen Governance and Power#^c5ef99" href="locations\settlements\haven-of-hale\subpages\hellhapfen-governance-and-power.html#^c5ef99" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Archprelate of Binds</a> maintains an iron grip on security.

<br><br>(Residential &amp; Clerical Housing)<br>
<br>A dense multi-tiered district stacked along the city’s steepest inclines, where the city’s middle class and clerical administrators reside. Golemic lifts, powered by arcane electricity, ferry people between levels.
<br><br>(Industrial Slums &amp; Low-Class Housing)<br>
<br>A smog-choked, overcrowded district where factory workers, dock laborers, and debt-bound "Redemptives" toil beneath the looming spires of the wealthier districts above.
<br><br>(Shrouded &amp; Haunted Ruins)<br>
<br>The oldest part of the city, a ghostly, mist-covered ruin from the elemental storm’s fallout centuries ago. Few dare to live here, but some black-market traders, fugitives, and heretics hide in the mist-choked alleyways.
<br><br><br>Due to Hellhaven’s steep and winding streets, traditional carts struggle to traverse the city. Instead, the following alternative transportation methods have developed:<br>
<br>Treadwalkers – Clockwork exoskeletal frames, resembling steam-powered stilts, allow couriers and enforcers to ascend steep roads with ease.
<br>Golemic Lifts – Towering arcane-powered elevators assist movement between altitude levels, commonly found in Penitent’s Rise and The Tribunal Forum.
<br>Skyferries – Suspended tram-like gondolas, powered by arcane-electric current, ferry goods and passengers across the city’s highest districts.
<br>Canal Ferries – Many of Hellhaven’s lower districts have waterways, where flat-bottomed steam skiffs operate as taxi services.
<br><br>
<br>Checkpoint System – Each district has controlled entry points where movement is monitored. Travel papers are required for restricted areas, such as The Adjudicary.
<br>Curfew Enforcement – At sundown, non-essential movement is forbidden unless sanctioned.
<br><br>
<br>The Gate of Submission – The main landward entry into Hellhaven, where newcomers are interrogated and documented.

<br>The Inner Gates – Sections of the city are separated by gated corridors, restricting access to sensitive areas.
<br><br><br>Hellhaven’s architecture is built with a mix of local stone, imported steel, and arcane-powered lighting:<br>
<br>Obsidian-Grey Brick &amp; Ironwood Reinforcement – The foundational material for most buildings, durable enough to withstand the coastal gales.
<br>Arcane-Electric Streetlights – Imported from <a data-href="Vergrenzig" href="locations\settlements\to-be-fleshed\vergrenzig.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vergrenzig</a>, these tesla-like lamps harness engineered magic, emitting a steady white-blue glow.

<br><br><br>
<br>Hellhaven, originally Gellhafn, was founded as a sanctuary for refugees fleeing the devastation of the elemental storms of the <a data-href="Tenechron" href="lore\time\eras\tenechron.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tenechron</a>—a catastrophic event that left arcane-laden mist lingering along the coastline.
<br>The city’s first settlers were survivors, building atop the ruins of a preexisting civilization, remnants of which still exist in Wraithmire Quarter.

<br><a data-href="Vergrenzig" href="locations\settlements\to-be-fleshed\vergrenzig.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vergrenzig</a>’s steampunk innovations reached Hellhaven, revolutionizing shipbuilding, arcane-electric power, and mechanical craftsmanship.

<br>Under their rule, Gellhafn was renamed Hellhaven, a "bastion of order in a world of chaos."
<br>The great edicts were established: law, obedience, and industry above all else.
<br><br>
<br>Hellhaven is at a crossroads, torn between its theocratic law and the technological advancements reshaping society.

<br>Legislation

(Foundational legal doctrines of Hellhaven)
The Unerring Edict
"A city without law is a body without a spine. Obedience brings order, and order brings salvation."

<br>The core document that codifies governance, labor divisions, and citizen obligations.


The Creed of Tribute
"To each, their station; to each, their due. That which is given in sacrifice is repaid in divine favor."

<br>Governs tithes, taxation, and labor servitude.


The Concord of Balance
"Punishment must be just, mercy must be measured, and order must be absolute."

<br>The legal standard for crime, sentencing, and civic discipline.



A remnant from Hellhaven’s past as Gellhafn, before the rise of the clergy, this body of law governs the foundational civic structures of the city—property rights, inheritance, and the classification of citizens. Though much of it has been rewritten to fit <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Concordat of Chains" data-href="Concordat of Chains" href="organizations\concordat-of-chains.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Concordat of Chains</a>' doctrine, some old maritime and trade laws remain in effect.
The Charter of Harbormasters
An ancient decree that regulates docking fees, ship registrations, and the division of waterfront properties. It is one of the few pre-theocracy laws still honored by both secular traders and the clergy.


A maritime legal framework developed in agreement with the other major coastal powers of <a data-href="Loierr Fenest" href="locations\regions\loierr-fenest.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Loierr Fenest</a> to regulate trade routes, naval engagements, and piracy control.

<br>Tinker’s Tongue – A blend of Vergrenzig technical jargon and Hellhaven’s common tongue, used by artificers, mechanists, and alchemists in The Ironclad Sprawl.
<br><br><br>Hellhaven’s culture is shaped by its history of elemental catastrophe, religious governance, and technological advancement.<br>
<br>Obedience and Regulation – Society is bound by strict legal codes, enforced from childhood. Even street slang retains legalistic phrasing, and contracts, ledgers, and bureaucratic approvals dominate daily life.

<br>Arcane-Infused Brews – Drinks such as Glowgin (a luminescent, mildly energizing spirit) and Ether-Touched Brandy (a distilled liquor rumored to heighten awareness).
<br><br>
<br>The High Clergy and Merchants – The wealthy elite live in opulent, towering spires with private lifts and skyferries. Their homes feature imported Vergrenzig luxuries, from self-winding automata to electric chandeliers.
<br>The Industrial Class – Artificers, mechanists, and engineers earn stable incomes but remain under strict legal contracts, often forced into long-term service to their guilds.
<br>The Debt-Bound and Redemptives – The lowest class lives in overcrowded, soot-choked housing, often forced into "redemptive labor," working in factories, shipyards, or clerical archives under surveillance.
<br><br>Hellhaven is suspicious of foreigners, but trade keeps the city’s gates open. How outsiders are treated depends on their background and purpose:<br>
<br>Vergrenzig Traders – Accepted as necessary trade partners, though many resent their influence. Their free-market ideals clash with Hellhaven’s controlled economy.
<br>Drifters and Vagabonds – Viewed with distrust, often forced into Redemptive Service if caught without papers.
<br>Religious Dissidents – Treated as heretics, often exiled or publicly condemned.
<br>Innovators and Mechanists – Welcomed cautiously, but their work is heavily regulated by the clergy.

 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Description
Hellhaven is a sprawling city located at the eastern edge of <a data-href="Loierr Fenest" href="locations\regions\loierr-fenest.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Loierr Fenest</a>, where the fjord meets the <a data-href="Windbor Coast" href="locations\regions\windbor-coast.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Windbor Coast</a>. Founded in 1933, it became the epicenter of human theocracy, built upon the arrival of both humans and their god. The city serves as both a seat of power and a beacon of divine influence, with towering temples and dark spires dominating the skyline. Hellhaven’s streets are a mix of industrialization, religious fervor, and societal control, reflecting both the power of <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a> and the struggles of those living under his rule. Despite its oppressive atmosphere, Hellhaven remains a thriving hub of political and religious activity, drawing citizens and refugees alike seeking to live under the strict doctrine of <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>.
Hellhaven’s history is one of divine governance, military dominance, and a slow shift from the natural to the imposed. Once, the land was fertile and lush, but now it bears the scars of overuse and divine exertion. The city's buildings rise tall, made from black stone and wrought iron, often shrouded in a perpetual haze from residual Tenechronian magic that permeates the air.
Hellhaven is considered a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Settlement Classification Chart > ^bafa77" data-href="Settlement Classification Chart#^bafa77" href="meta\settlement-classification-chart.html#^bafa77" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Metropolis</a>.


Dark and Heavy: The air is thick with a sense of saltwater and incense, accompanied by the constant hum of religious rituals. The scent of burning offerings lingers in every corner, and the oppressive weight of divine oversight hangs over the city like a perpetual storm cloud. 

Devout and Subjugated: The citizens of Hellhaven live under a strict theocracy, their lives governed by <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>’s will. Religion and governance are inseparable, and almost every aspect of daily life is influenced by the city’s devout clergy. Despite this, there are murmurs of dissent among the more oppressed and disenfranchised groups, though open rebellion is rare due to the constant surveillance and control of the Inquisitors.<br>
Resilient but Fearful: The people of Hellhaven have learned to live with fear and reverence, constantly watching their actions, thoughts, and words. The deep piety instilled by the church is a double-edged sword—while it provides a sense of purpose and unity, it also stifles any attempts at self-expression or deviation from the divine law.<br>
Class Divisions: The city is deeply divided into classes, with the clergy and military occupying the highest echelons, while the common folk serve in subjugation to <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>'s divine will. The lower classes are relegated to menial tasks, working the factories and serving the wealthy, while the elite enjoy the privileges of power and influence.

Enforced Piety: Hellhaven is renowned for its unwavering dedication to <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>. Its citizens are constantly reminded of their place within the divine order, with the clergy acting as the primary enforcers of religious law. The Inquisitors, a military and religious police force, patrol the city, ensuring that no one deviates from the prescribed teachings and practices.<br>
Cultural Repression: Hellhaven’s culture is one of strict obedience to <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>’s will. Festivals and celebrations are rare, often occurring only during holy days or the anniversaries of significant religious events. Even then, they are imbued with solemnity and reverence, lacking the joy or exuberance found in other cities. Secretive underground movements occasionally attempt to overthrow the established order, but they are always stamped out swiftly by the ruling authorities.<br>
Power Struggles: While outwardly Hellhaven appears unified under the rule of <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>, there are political struggles between various factions of the clergy and military. These factions vie for influence and power, and while they may outwardly present a united front, there are deep fractures within the system that often lead to covert power struggles.<br>
Religious Sanctity: Despite its oppressive nature, Hellhaven is a pilgrimage site for those seeking divine enlightenment or wishing to prove their devotion to <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>. Pilgrims travel from across the land to pay homage to <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>’s temples, seeking blessings or guidance, often unaware of the city’s darker underbelly.
<br>Residents
Hellhaven is a city of devout followers and those desperate enough to seek refuge within its walls. Its population is primarily composed of humans, with a significant number of military personnel, clergy, and administrative officials. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Concordat of Chains" data-href="Concordat of Chains" href="organizations\concordat-of-chains.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Concordat of Chains</a> holds the most power, serving as both enforcers of divine law and elite military agents. The lower classes often live in fear, working in the factories or serving the clergy in menial ways.
Some come to Hellhaven out of necessity—many by birth, others by the will of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Concordat of Chains" data-href="Concordat of Chains" href="organizations\concordat-of-chains.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Concordat</a>, and some seeking salvation or answers from <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>. However, dissent is brewing beneath the surface. Underground movements and secret alliances work to resist the city’s divine control, though they are largely unsuccessful due to the ever-watchful eye of the <a data-href="Creosmagi" href="organizations\creosmagi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Creosmagi</a>.
While Hellhaven is a city of faith, it is also a place of secrecy, danger, and political intrigue, where the line between devotion and manipulation is often blurred.

<br>History and Lore
The history of Hellhaven is closely tied to the city’s foundation being built on a newfound gift of calming storms; Gellhafn. Over time, Gellhafn became a mercantile giant, but its power base later shifted from a port town to a sprawling city-state ruled by the clergy and military.
During the later years of the city’s formation, tensions arose between the mercantile elites and the <a data-href="Concordat of Chains" href="organizations\concordat-of-chains.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Concordat of Chains</a>, both seeking to claim authority of Gellhafn. These tensions came to a head during after The Dread, when Gellhafn’s political climate shifted to give credit to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Hellhapfen Governance and Power > ^abc6e7" data-href="Hellhapfen Governance and Power#^abc6e7" href="locations\settlements\haven-of-hale\subpages\hellhapfen-governance-and-power.html#^abc6e7" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Creed of Blinding Light</a>, now willing to believe that a higher power was communicating through global catastrophe to express dissent about magical regulation.
Despite these challenges, Gellhafn become Hellhaven, who still survives, though city life is constricted through both religious fervor and mercantile control. The city’s infrastructure became more complex, with the creation of the <a data-href="Creosmagi" href="organizations\creosmagi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Creosmagi</a> as both a religious police force and a military arm of <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>’s divine will. Today, Hellhaven stands as a symbol of divine rule and unwavering order, although beneath its holy exterior lies a web of political intrigue and hidden rebellion.

 <br><br><br>Hellhaven is a meticulously planned city, structured around strict principles of order and efficiency dictated by <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>’s adjudicators.

<br>A smog-choked, overcrowded district where factory workers, dock laborers, and debt-bound "Redemptives" toil beneath the looming spires of the wealthier districts above.
<br><br>(Shrouded &amp; Haunted Ruins)<br>
<br>The oldest part of the city, a ghostly, mist-covered ruin from the elemental storm’s fallout centuries ago. Few dare to live here, but some black-market traders, fugitives, and heretics hide in the mist-choked alleyways.
<br><br><br>Due to Hellhaven’s steep and winding streets, traditional carts struggle to traverse the city. Instead, the following alternative transportation methods have developed:<br>
<br>Treadwalkers – Clockwork exoskeletal frames, resembling steam-powered stilts, allow couriers and enforcers to ascend steep roads with ease.
<br>Golemic Lifts – Towering arcane-powered elevators assist movement between altitude levels, commonly found in Penitent’s Rise and The Tribunal Forum.
<br>Skyferries – Suspended tram-like gondolas, powered by arcane-electric current, ferry goods and passengers across the city’s highest districts.
<br>Canal Ferries – Many of Hellhaven’s lower districts have waterways, where flat-bottomed steam skiffs operate as taxi services.
<br><br>
<br>Checkpoint System – Each district has controlled entry points where movement is monitored. Travel papers are required for restricted areas, such as The Adjudicary.
<br>Curfew Enforcement – At sundown, non-essential movement is forbidden unless sanctioned.
<br><br>
<br>The Gate of Submission – The main landward entry into Hellhaven, where newcomers are interrogated and documented.
<br>Brineyard Inspection Docks – All ships must register cargo and passengers upon arrival. Unregistered arrivals face severe punishment. Located in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Chainmoor Brine Yards _(Docks &amp; Industrial Shipping)_" data-href="#Chainmoor Brine Yards _(Docks &amp; Industrial Shipping)_" href="about:blank#Chainmoor_Brine_Yards__(Docks_&amp;_Industrial_Shipping)_" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Chainmoor Brine Yards</a>.
<br>The Inner Gates – Sections of the city are separated by gated corridors, restricting access to sensitive areas.
<br><br><br>Hellhaven’s architecture is built with a mix of local stone, imported steel, and arcane-powered lighting:<br>
<br>Obsidian-Grey Brick &amp; Ironwood Reinforcement – The foundational material for most buildings, durable enough to withstand the coastal gales.
<br>Arcane-Electric Streetlights – Imported from <a data-href="Vergrenzig" href="locations\settlements\to-be-fleshed\vergrenzig.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vergrenzig</a>, these tesla-like lamps harness engineered magic, emitting a steady white-blue glow.

<br><br><br>
<br>Hellhaven, originally Gellhafn, was founded as a sanctuary for refugees fleeing the devastation of the elemental storms of the <a data-href="Tenechron" href="lore\time\eras\tenechron.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tenechron</a>—a catastrophic event that left arcane-laden mist lingering along the coastline.
<br>The city’s first settlers were survivors, building atop the ruins of a preexisting civilization, remnants of which still exist in Wraithmire Quarter.
<br><br>
<br><a data-href="Vergrenzig" href="locations\settlements\to-be-fleshed\vergrenzig.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vergrenzig</a>’s steampunk innovations reached Hellhaven, revolutionizing shipbuilding, arcane-electric power, and mechanical craftsmanship.

<br>Under their rule, Gellhafn was renamed Hellhaven, a "bastion of order in a world of chaos."
<br>The great edicts were established: law, obedience, and industry above all else.
<br><br>
<br>Hellhaven is at a crossroads, torn between its theocratic law and the technological advancements reshaping society.

<br>Hidden Chamber: A vaulted, sea-sprayed cavern beneath the shop, where arcane trinkets float weightlessly in lantern-lit glass cases. Some items still hum with residual magic, while others seem eager to be held.

 <br><br>Organic Layout: Dwellings in Vrellyn follow an organic pattern, spreading out from central hubs like the College District and Exomarket. Houses are often multi-level, with the upper floors built into the canopy of the trees and lower levels extending underground.<br>
Clustered Communities: Homes are grouped into clusters around communal spaces like gardens or water sources, fostering a sense of community. The architecture is deeply intertwined with the natural landscape, using living plants as part of the structure.<br>
Adaptive Designs: Homes are designed to adapt to their inhabitants' needs, with spaces that can shift or grow over time thanks to magical and botanical integration. These dwellings often feature hanging gardens, integrated moss insulation, and vine-covered facades.<br><br>Partially Planned: While the original settlement grew organically, modern Vrellyn has undergone careful planning, especially after major events like the <a data-href="Tenechron" href="lore\time\eras\tenechron.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tenechron</a>. The central districts like the College District and Exomarket are well-planned, with efficient layouts to support trade and education.<br>
Adaptive Planning: The city’s planners work closely with druids and biomancers to ensure that expansion or redevelopment projects respect the natural flow of the environment. This results in a balance between planned infrastructure and organic growth, allowing the city to remain flexible and resilient.<br><br>
<br>College District
<br>Agricultural District
<br>Hivedrums
<br>Laboratorium
<br>The Exomarket
<br><br>Vrellyn’s thoroughfares are designed to blend seamlessly with the natural environment. The city’s streets and pathways are often winding and interconnected, painting an impression of the Glistening Canopy’s roots and branches.<br>Main Arteries: The primary roads are broad and well-maintained, lined with bioluminescent plants that provide natural lighting. These lead to key districts like the <a data-href="College District" href="College District" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">College District</a>, <a data-href="Agricultural District" href="Agricultural District" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Agricultural District</a>, and <a data-href="Exomarket" href="Exomarket" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Exomarket</a>.<br>
Canopy Paths: Elevated walkways and rope bridges crisscross the upper levels of the city, allowing for efficient travel between areas perched on the massive trees of the Glistening Canopy. These paths are crucial for navigating the verticality of the city.<br>
Subways: The Vrelline Undercity features a network of tunnels and caverns that connect various underground dwellings and workspaces, providing a sheltered alternative to surface travel.<br><br>On Foot: Given the city’s compact nature and integration with the forest, most residents travel on foot. The abundance of footpaths makes walking the easiest way to get around.<br>
Beast-Drawn Carriages: For transporting goods or those who prefer a less strenuous mode of travel, carriages drawn by domesticated plant or animal hybrids are used. These are common in the market and agricultural districts.<br>
Glider Systems: For longer distances or to quickly traverse the vertical spaces of the city, residents use personal or communal gliders. These devices, often made from lightweight wood and enchanted fabrics, allow for a quick descent from higher areas to lower ones.<br>
Golem Transport: Larger, mechanical biogolems are used for heavy lifting and transportation of bulk goods. These golems are designed to navigate both the streets and canopy paths efficiently.<br>
Canopy Lifts: Elevator-like platforms powered by a combination of magic and natural forces (e.g., vine growth mechanisms) connect the ground level with the canopy. They are used for moving people and goods between the different levels of the city.<br>
Waterways: In the Undercity, waterways fed by underground streams provide a mode of travel via small boats. These ferries are essential for transporting goods within the subterranean sections of the city.<br>
Spiral Stairways: Carved directly into the massive trunks of the Glistening Canopy trees, these stairways offer a more direct and physically demanding route for those who prefer or require a slower descent.<br><br>Vertical Expansion: After the <a data-href="Tenechron" href="lore\time\eras\tenechron.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tenechron</a>, the city has thrived and been motivated to use the caverns below to expand its real estate. Alongside this expansion, their culture of protecting the ecology around them has ensured they design any vertical expansion to harmonize with the jungle around them. The availability of glider systems and canopy lifts has allowed Vrellyn to expand upwards into the towering trees of the Glistening Canopy, maximizing space without disrupting the delicate ecosystem.<br>
Trade Efficiency: The combination of beast-drawn carriages, golem transports, and waterways ensures that trade within the city is efficient. This has supported the growth of the Exomarket and allowed Vrellyn to become a hub for medicinal goods.<br>
Community Connectivity: The organic layout of the thoroughfares, coupled with the elevated paths and natural lighting, fosters a sense of connectedness among residents. The transportation system encourages communal interaction and accessibility.<br><br>Secrecy and Protection: Vrellyn’s hidden nature makes leaving and re-entering the city a controlled process. The city is well-concealed within the <a data-href="Glistening Canopy" href="locations\landforms\glistening-canopy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Glistening Canopy</a>, with only a few known entry points.<br>
Restricted Access: Entrances to the city are guarded, and travelers must pass through security checks to prevent the spread of infection from <a data-href="Hly'draug" href="locations\regions\hly'draug.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hly'draug</a>. Visitors are rare, and those who do enter are typically required to have a local sponsor or purpose.<br>
Ease for Residents: For Vrellians, leaving the city is relatively straightforward through known and safe routes. However, re-entering requires adherence to strict quarantine protocols, especially for those returning from expeditions to <a data-href="Hly'draug" href="locations\regions\hly'draug.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hly'draug</a> or other potentially hazardous areas.<br>
Outsider Challenges: Outsiders find it challenging to locate Vrellyn without guidance. The city’s paths are well-hidden, and natural barriers such as dense vegetation and magical wards deter uninvited guests.<br><br><br>
<br>Zurkhwood: Primary material for both structural and decorative purposes.
<br>Natural Stone: Quarried from the Undercity and used for foundations and pathways.
<br>Bioluminescent Fungi: Incorporated into walls and ceilings for illumination.
<br>Vines and Moss: Used for reinforcement and aesthetic purposes, integrating buildings with the natural environment.
<br>The surface dwellings majorly consist of an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Kagecombs" data-href="Kagecombs" href="locations\regions\kagecombs.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kagekunan</a> megafungi called <a data-href="Zurkhwood" href="Zurkhwood" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Zurkhwood</a>. This cultivated resource allows for the incorporation of biological integration into the surface structures of Vrellyn. This allows architecture to be supported by and integrated into the local arboreal flora, as well as support hanging gardens along their exterior surfaces. Because of this, moss and vines play a large role in the decorational and functional aspects of the architecture in Vrellyn. It is not uncommon to use hanging strands to create passable barriers within households since most of the city is already protected from weather by the forest canopy.<br><br>Various parts of the city have been redeveloped over time. The Undercity was significantly expanded during the Tenechron, creating new living spaces and fortifications. Surface areas have seen renovations to adapt to new threats and advancements in biogolemancy.<br>Sustainable Growth: Redevelopment projects prioritize sustainability, ensuring that new constructions or renovations enhance the natural environment rather than disrupt it. This approach has led to a cityscape that feels both ancient and forward-looking.<br><br>The <a data-href="Vrelline College of Horticulture and Biomancy" href="Vrelline College of Horticulture and Biomancy" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vrelline College of Horticulture and Biomancy</a> stands as tall as the megaflora arborea that the forest is known for.<br><br><br>Vrellyn’s dense canopy and magical enhancements create a unique microclimate. The thick foliage and water features regulate temperature, keeping the city cooler during the day and warmer at night. The magical wards help maintain this balance, making the city an oasis of stability amidst the unpredictable weather of the surrounding regions.<br>Controlled Humidity: The canopy captures and redistributes moisture, leading to consistent humidity that supports the lush plant life. This microclimate is crucial for the growth of the medicinal plants that the city relies on.<br><br>Flora
Medicinal Herbs: Such as Glowbloom and Heartroot, cultivated for their healing properties.<br>
Megaflora Trees: Towering trees that form the backbone of the city’s architecture.
<br>Fauna
Symbiotic Creatures: Including leafdrakes and glimmer moths, which coexist with the residents.<br>
Domestic Fungi-Beasts: Used for transportation and labor.
<br>Pests
Fungal Parasites: Occasionally infest crops or structures, requiring regular maintenance.<br>
Sporespiders: Small, web-spinning creatures that can cause minor issues if left unchecked.

This ceremony is a formal induction for graduates of the <a data-href="Vrelline College of Horticulture and Biomancy" href="Vrelline College of Horticulture and Biomancy" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vrelline College of Horticulture and Biomancy</a> that signifies their readiness to serve in an extension of either the <a data-href="Council of Healers" href="Council of Healers" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Council of Healers</a> or <a data-href="Pharmopol" href="Pharmopol" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Pharmopol</a>. The existing legislation requires that graduates complete a year of service in either the city's various free clinics or under the tutelage of governmental research teams before being allowed to establish an independent practice.


Chronicles of the Tenechron
Those historians who survived the exodus to the <a data-href="Kagecombs" href="locations\regions\kagecombs.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kagecombs</a>, after the apocalyptic storms of Tenechron, kept themselves busy with the documentation of survival practices and emergency technique learned during travel through the unfamiliar maze of caverns. These records also include what scouts could glean was occurring on the surface, and speculate at the cause of the elemental storms. These lessons allowed Vrellyn to learn from its newfound resources within the caves beneath its surface, expanding its reach underground and harnessing the symbiotic capabilities of the native fungi in the effort towards harmonizing architecture with the surrounding ecosystem.

Tales of the Ancient Treants
This collection of scrolls and woven tablets has been protected by the very first leaders of the historic preservation movement that led to the establishment of the <a data-href="Harmonium of Lore" href="organizations\harmonium-of-lore.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Harmonium of Lore</a>, passed down from the original treant elders to the high druids that once led the early development of the Vrelline settlement. However, some of this ancient wisdom was only passed down by word of mouth, and between this and the translation of ancient Sylvan dialects, many of these tales have been received as fabular, leaving each tale's level of truth to be up to interpretation.


Regulation of Biogolemancy
This group of legislative documents recount the various regulations and laws pertaining to the creation and use of biogolems, ensuring both ethicality and safety to themselves and those around them. These guidelines provide strict limitations regarding the experimentation and patenting of biogolems, requiring all golem designs be registered and inspected by <a data-href="Pharmopol" href="Pharmopol" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Pharmopol</a> on a regular basis.

Anti-Plague Measures
With the threat of fungal infection outbreaks on the horizon at all times, legislation was required to unite the populace against the spread of <a data-href="Hly'draug" href="locations\regions\hly'draug.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hly'draug</a>. This documentation includes information about quarantine measures, the enforcement of the use of air masks, and penalties for violating such countermeasures.

Black Market Oversight
In more current events, a response towards the recent uprisings against the distribution and testing of unsanctioned drugs through illicit trade. Enforced by the merchants' guild, this law's goal is to ensure that dangerous and experimental drugs are kept from the open market, and that only approved drugs are introduced to the public. The law also defines legal practices used when handling drug-related crimes, including topics regarding justice and rehabilitation.


Songs of the Canopy
A collection of ancestral songs performed during community events and ceremonies, the origins of which are muddled with the passage of time. Some have not been translated, their melodic vocalization being the only memory of their existence, devoid of diction. Some religious sects believe them to have ancient celestial meaning, but they remain a jumble of vowels on paper. Many of the tunes have been repurposed with updated lyrics, then taught in schools to foster cultural identity and unity among the citizenry.

Legends of the Glistening Sentinels
A group of upstanding citizens have become immortalized within the Halls of Reflection where the <a data-href="Harmonium of Lore" href="organizations\harmonium-of-lore.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Harmonium of Lore</a> are headquartered. Their stories are woven with fact and fiction, but their accomplishments are what children aspiring to when pursuing government positions; teaching them to present with pride and vigilance in their education and societal contributions. These heroes of yore are incorporated into education and public ceremonies, inspiring many to seek an alcove among them within the Halls of Reflection.

<br><br>Council of Healers (Medica Primor)
Role: Governs the city’s healthcare and medical research. They regulate the development and distribution of medicinal products.<br>
Emblem: A stylized mortar and pestle entwined with a vine, symbolizing their focus on healing and nature.
<br>Pharmopol (Praesidium Viridis)
Role: Protects the city from external threats, particularly those from Hly'draug. They oversee the city’s defenses and lead exploratory missions.<br>
Emblem: A shield with a leaf motif, with a biogolem etched at the center, symbolizing strength and natural guardianship.
<br>Merchant Guild of Vital Trades (Gilda Vitalis)
Role: Manages trade and the city’s economy. They ensure the flow of resources and maintain the balance between import and export.<br>
Emblem: A bundle of herbs and a coin, representing the intersection of commerce and the city’s herbal wealth.
<br>Harmonium of Lore (Harmonia Loria)
Role: Preserves the city’s history, culture, and legal systems. They oversee the educational institutions and public records.<br>
Emblem: An open book with a glowing orb, signifying knowledge and enlightenment.
<br>Vrelline College of Horticulture and Biomancy

Emblem: A tree with intertwining roots and branches, with a bright flower at its peak, symbolizing growth and discovery.
<br><br>There is crime within Vrellyn, the most impactful being due to unsanctioned trial testing of drugs before they have been released to market. This is highly illegal but it is how upstart and/or desperate pharmacologists gain footing within the industry. These tests are targeted towards the poor, homeless, preexisting addicts, and incarcerated criminals. Since the target groups are already in a state of misfortune, this particular flavor of crime ensures that that class of people remains on the bottom rungs of society. <br>Additionally, there are those that seek the sale of performance-enhancing drugs that assist in the conducting of illicit activities. These drugs are often used as a way to avoid incarceration, either by enhancing their ability to fight local authorities, or avoid them entirely.<br>]]></description><link>locations\settlements\the-verdant-city\subpages\vrelline-governance-and-power.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Locations/Settlements/The Verdant City/Subpages/Vrelline Governance and Power.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 20:53:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vrelline Mysticism and Threats]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>The founders knew of the potential held by the mutations within <a data-href="Hly'draug" href="locations\regions\hly'draug.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hly'draug</a>, but needed a barrier between the monstrosities that lurked within and their home. Creating an outpost within the <a data-href="Glistening Canopy" href="locations\landforms\glistening-canopy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Glistening Canopy</a> allowed them to monitor the spread of the swamp's influence, as well as reinforce the border between the two biomes. This way they could conduct analysis from afar while still having easy access to sampling of biomaterials.<br><br>The main threat to Vrellyn is <a data-href="Hly'draug" href="locations\regions\hly'draug.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hly'draug</a> to the south. This swampland has been infected by spores originating from the <a data-href="Underdark" href="Underdark" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Underdark</a>, making the creatures under its control a hierarchical hive mind. Each infected creature is connected to both its infector's mind, as well as those that it infects directly. When infected, a creature is overridden by these fungal growths, functionally killing the host but preserving its physical capabilities, if not enhancing them through mutagens meant to adapt to the swamp's environment. These mutations make the infected lethal hunters within this biome, as the flora and fauna that make up its existence have become allies to each of the infected creatures residing within.<br>The inhabitants of Vrellyn have adapted to this through the creation of natural filtration. Through the combination of artifice and biomancy, the <a data-href="Council of Healers" href="Council of Healers" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Council of Healers</a> created what are simply called air masks. <br>Note

By allowing an arcanely-enhanced local vine to grow over a filtration mesh, the aromatic and dermis excretions of the vine neutralize any airborne spores and infectants. Instead, the microscopic dermis excretions take the hit, becoming infected by any intake of infectants, then they soon after die off after being separated from the vine. The biomancy becomes prevalent at this point in the process, essentially cauterizing the dead biomass as soon as it dies, ensuring that any infectants are deceased as well before they are ingested by the mask wearer.
While the wearer of the air mask has it donned, the creature has advantage on saving throws against airborne poisons and diseases that the mask was NOT specifically created for. The creature also has immunity from the airborne infectant it WAS created for. In addition, the wearer has resistance to poison damage that is applied through an airborne cloud or other inhalant.
Cursed Object. If this mask is worn consistently enough (i.e. 8 hrs per day consecutively for a year), then the wearer becomes dependent on its filtration properties. Once the humanoid creature has adapted to rely on the clean air provided by the air mask, it becomes vulnerable to other infections when the creature is not wearing the mask. While the mask is doffed, the cursed creature has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws against disease and the poisoned condition. In addition, they are vulnerable to poison damage while the mask is doffed. 
<br>Additionally, <a data-href="Pharmopol" href="Pharmopol" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Pharmopol</a> has begun to harness the animative properties of the <a data-href="Hly'draug" href="locations\regions\hly'draug.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hly'draug</a> spores. Through them, more agile and autonomous arcane golems have been developed. Many Vrelline golemancers believe that the spores have revolutionized the creation of autonomous golems. These golems are often assigned to security posts within the city, but are also known to accompany excursions into <a data-href="Hly'draug" href="locations\regions\hly'draug.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hly'draug</a> when research calls for further samples or city safety calls for scouting missions to assess the threat-level of the borders of the swamp.<br><br>Everyday Enhancements: Magic is a fundamental part of life in Vrellyn, with enchantments woven into daily activities. Streetlights are bioluminescent fungi enhanced with minor illumination spells, and public spaces often feature ambient sound-dampening enchantments to create serene environments.<br>
Integrated Infrastructure: Buildings are supported by magical growth spells that encourage structures made from Zurkhwood to self-repair and adapt to environmental changes. Magical wards protect the city from external threats, particularly from the encroaching rot of Hly'draug.<br>
Biogolem Assistance: Golems imbued with arcane energy are used for various tasks, from guarding the city to assisting in agricultural activities. These biogolems are a blend of magic and nature, reflecting the city's innovative spirit.<br><br>Pantheon of Nature Spirits: Vrellyn’s primary spiritual focus is on the worship of nature spirits and fey deities. Temples and shrines dedicated to these entities are scattered throughout the city, often integrated into natural settings like groves or ponds.<br>
Seasonal Festivals: Major rites and festivals align with the changing seasons, celebrating the cycles of nature. The Festival of Vital Bloom and the Harvest of Light are significant events that involve the entire community.<br>
Personal Rites: Citizens often have private altars in their homes or gardens, where they perform daily rituals to honor the spirits and seek blessings for health and prosperity.<br><br>
<br>Festival of Vital Bloom (Spring)

<br>Description: A celebration of the peak blooming season, focusing on the city’s botanical heritage. The festival includes public displays of medicinal plants, communal feasts, and performances that honor the ancient treants.
<br>Activities: Herbal workshops, parades of bioluminescent flora, and a grand ceremony where the Council of Healers blesses the new crops.


<br>Harvest of Light (Autumn)

<br>Description: Marking the end of the harvest season, this festival focuses on the collection of bioluminescent fungi. The city is adorned with glowing decorations, and citizens partake in nighttime processions and light shows.
<br>Activities: Lantern-making contests, storytelling under the stars, and a concluding feast lit by the harvested fungi.


<br>Day of the Verdant Pact (Summer Solstice)

<br>Description: A day to honor the alliance between Vrellyn and the Verdant Pact, celebrating the unity of druids, biomancers, and the natural world.
<br>Activities: Rituals at sacred groves, offerings to nature spirits, and communal tree-planting events.


<br>Eclipse of Reflection (Every Solar Eclipse)

<br>Description: A solemn event where citizens reflect on their connection to the fey and the balance of magic in their lives. The eclipse is seen as a time to seek wisdom and guidance from Yphrhei and other mystical entities.
<br>Activities: Meditation gatherings, vision quests led by druids, and the sharing of personal revelations in community circles.

<br><br>Elarion the Verdant Flame
Era: The Gnosichron (Founding Era)
Accomplishments:

<br>Elarion, a druid with a fiery connection to the elemental forces, was instrumental in the city's early defense against the first wave of Hly'draug’s infected creatures.

<br>He led a daring expedition deep into the swamp, securing samples of the rot that would later be used to develop the first anti-fungal treatments, laying the groundwork for Vrellyn’s pharmaceutical prowess.

<br>Sylvara the Rootbinder
Era: The Mid-Gnosichron (Expansion Period)
Accomplishments:

<br>A biomancer who could command the roots and trees of the Glistening Canopy, Sylvara created a living barrier known as the Emerald Wall, a network of sentient plants that shielded the city from marauding creatures.
<br>She is also credited with domesticating the Leafdrakes, training them to assist in surveillance and message delivery, enhancing communication across Vrellyn.

<br>Tharion Stonefist of the Canopy
Era: The Tenechron (Catastrophe Era)
Accomplishments:

<br>Tharion, a dwarf warrior who joined Vrellyn during the Tenechron, became a symbol of resilience. His Stonefist Brigade fortified the Undercity, creating impregnable defenses that protected the refugees from the chaos above.

<br>Ailindra "Whisper of the Moths"
Era: Post-Tenechron (Rebuilding Era)
Accomplishments:

<br>A fey-touched bard, Ailindra played a pivotal role in restoring morale and unity in the aftermath of the Tenechron. She composed the Moth’s Lament, a haunting melody that calmed the traumatized citizens and became a ritualistic song for reflection and healing.

<br>Kaelen the Nightwatcher
Era: Current Era
Accomplishments:

<br>Kaelen, a ranger of unparalleled skill, is known for his nocturnal patrols along the borders of Hly'draug. His ability to navigate the dangerous terrain at night earned him the title of Nightwatcher.
<br>He devised the Shadowveil Cloak, an enchanted garment that blends the wearer into the shadows, making them nearly invisible. This invention has become standard issue for scouts and protectors of Vrellyn.
<br>Kaelen’s relentless vigilance has thwarted multiple incursions, earning him the respect of both the <a data-href="Pharmopol" href="Pharmopol" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Pharmopol</a> and the general populace.

 <br>A Mysterious Haven: Vrellyn is known as a city of wonders, shrouded in mystery due to its hidden location within the Glistening Canopy. Outsiders regard it with a mix of awe and caution, often hearing tales of its advanced medicines, formidable defenses, and the eerie presence of biogolems.<br>
A Beacon of Healing: For those in need of medical aid, Vrellyn is a beacon of hope. The city’s reputation for curing rare diseases and its mastery of botanical magic draws pilgrims and merchants alike, despite the perilous journey to reach it.<br>
A Place of Secrecy: Some see Vrellyn as secretive and insular, suspicious of its reluctance to fully open its borders. Stories of the city’s internal struggles, particularly involving class disparity and the shadowy dealings of the Vrelline Undercity, paint a picture of a society grappling with its own dark undercurrents.<br><br>

Words are often elongated, with a lilt at the end of sentences, reflecting the city's tranquil and mystical atmosphere. The accent is more pronounced in those who spend time in the upper canopy, while Hivedrum residents have a more clipped and practical speech pattern, reflecting their harsher environment.<br><br>
<br>Geographical Isolation:

<br>Vrellyn’s location within the dense and magical <a data-href="Glistening Canopy" href="locations\landforms\glistening-canopy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Glistening Canopy</a> has shaped its development into a self-sufficient and heavily fortified city. Its isolation has fostered a strong sense of community but also limited its exposure to outside cultural influences, creating a unique but insular society.


<br>Historical Conflicts:

<br>The city's history of plagues and invasions, particularly during the <a data-href="Gnosichron" href="lore\time\eras\gnosichron.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gnosichron</a> and <a data-href="Tenechron" href="lore\time\eras\tenechron.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tenechron</a>, has led to a culture of resilience and innovation. These events forced Vrellyn to develop advanced medical and defensive technologies, which continue to influence its focus on biogolemancy and sustainable living.


<br>Fey Influence:

<br>The proximity to fey realms has infused the city with an element of whimsy and unpredictability. The fey’s capricious nature has left a lasting impact on Vrellyn’s architecture, festivals, and even its legal system, which often includes clauses for dealing with magical mishaps and fey interventions.


<br>Economic Disparities:

<br>The division between the affluent surface dwellers and the struggling inhabitants of the Hivedrums has led to social tensions that shape political and economic policies. The growing discontent and potential for rebellion have become a significant factor in the city’s internal politics, influencing how resources are allocated and who holds power.


<br>Magical Anomalies:

<br>The presence of <a data-href="Yphrhei" href="Yphrhei" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Yphrhei</a> and other ancient entities within the <a data-href="Glistening Canopy" href="locations\landforms\glistening-canopy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Glistening Canopy</a> has created areas of unpredictable magical phenomena. These anomalies have made certain parts of the city and surrounding forest treacherous but also rich in arcane knowledge and resources, attracting scholars and adventurers despite the risks.


<br><br>Pride and Reverence: Most Vrellians take great pride in their city’s accomplishments, particularly in its medical advancements and harmonious integration with nature. They view Vrellyn as a beacon of hope and a testament to what can be achieved through cooperation and respect for the natural world.<br>
Awareness of Struggles: While many appreciate the beauty and innovation of the city, there is an undercurrent of tension regarding the social divide. Those in the Hivedrums are often more critical of the city’s leadership and seek greater equality and recognition.<br>
Guarded Optimism: The city’s proximity to the dangers of Hly'draug and the constant threat of external forces means that its citizens live with a sense of vigilance. However, their connection to the land and its protective magic gives them a cautious but hopeful outlook on the future.<br><br>Eclectic Cuisine: The local diet incorporates a wide array of plant-based ingredients, reflecting the city’s rich biodiversity and the inhabitants’ appreciation for natural flavors.<br><br>There is a large rich/poor gap, and there is a geographical gap as well. Those who are of higher class and individual importance to the city live above-ground, where there are limited structures and space for the city sprawl. With a hard border protecting Vrellyn from <a data-href="Hly'draug" href="locations\regions\hly'draug.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hly'draug</a>, and the challenge of expansion without damaging the biome excessively so as not to weaken their natural border defenses. This has raised the costs of developing new surfaceland housing, causing the poorer classes to reside below in the <a data-href="Kagecombs" href="locations\regions\kagecombs.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kagecombs</a>. In the undercity below, there are preexisting dwellings from during the <a data-href="Tenechron" href="lore\time\eras\tenechron.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tenechron</a>; this particular location was historically chosen due to its natural skylight exit and simultaneous freshwater river entrance into the water table below.<br><br>The outsiders of Vrellyn include the following demographics: dwarves, fey-descended humans, and gnomes. Integrating into the close-knit and isolated community that is Vrellian society is a slow and cautious process. Its insular nature makes moving to the Verdant City a feat at the easiest, but never a hostile experience. Skill and civic contribution is valued, and is often the key to finding a place among the community.<br>Most Vrellian dwarves descend from the clan of dwarves that assisted the subterranean refugees during the Tenechron after fleeing their own home to the northeast. Those who decided to stay in Vrellyn during the Luxichron are those who live there today. With them, they brought their ancestral craft and skills in masonry. Much of the development in the <a data-href="Hivedrums" href="locations\settlements\the-verdant-city\districts\hivedrums.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hivedrums</a> was done by this clan.<br>Gnome-kind throughout Umbrea became aware of Vrellyn's expertise in medicine and chemistry after <a data-href="Cuirefyn" href="locations\settlements\to-be-fleshed\cuirefyn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cuirefyn</a> revealed its ancestral ties to The Verdant City. Each gnomish settlement sent emissaries to learn these crafts, and many remained to put down roots and continue pursuing their interest. Originally these emissaries found residence in the Laboratorium District. <br>Some folk prefer the ambient presence of constant threat over the looming presence threat of happenstance. Some just want to reconnect to their faerie roots. Thus, fey-descended humanoids have come to seek refuge and a consistent life inside the Emerald Wall. Often, they integrate themselves into society first through the pursuit of education, followed by engagement with the civic cogs that keep the city safe and running.]]></description><link>locations\settlements\the-verdant-city\subpages\vrelline-society-and-culture.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Locations/Settlements/The Verdant City/Subpages/Vrelline Society and Culture.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 20:56:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vrellyn]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>History and Lore
 The first settlers of the area were further south, along the border of <a data-href="Hly'draug" href="locations\regions\hly'draug.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hly'draug</a> during the <a data-href="Gnosichron" href="lore\time\eras\gnosichron.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gnosichron</a>. Before the swamp was infested by infection, it was a thriving ecosystem of medicinal flora and awakened fauna. In fact, it was one of the few locations in which the ancestors of the ancient race of treants resided. Their collective wisdom of the area attracted druidic priests and healers, whose services attracted the accumulation of a community.
  The proximity to the swamp during the initial period of infection caused there to be an outbreak of <a data-href="The Plague" href="The Plague" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Plague</a>, which is an early iteration of the symptoms occurring from fungal infection from the <a data-href="Kagecombs" href="locations\regions\kagecombs.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kagecombs</a>. The settlement was quarantined and abandoned, leaving the meager few who appeared to be uninfected to find shelter within the <a data-href="Glistening Canopy" href="locations\landforms\glistening-canopy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Glistening Canopy</a>. The ancient treants were unable to escape with the rest of the town, but they imparted a final incantation unto the druids, who would later use it to reinforce the <a data-href="Glistening Canopy" href="locations\landforms\glistening-canopy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Glistening Canopy</a> from the spread of the <a data-href="Hly'draug" href="locations\regions\hly'draug.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hly'draug</a>. 
  This settlement was abandoned a second time during the <a data-href="Tenechron" href="lore\time\eras\tenechron.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tenechron</a>. Most residents found their way towards settlements far away from old <a data-href="Vrellyn" href="locations\settlements\the-verdant-city\vrellyn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vrellyn</a>, including a large group that traveled northwest to find the <a data-href="Kagecombs" href="locations\regions\kagecombs.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kagecombs</a> marshland below <a data-href="Cuirefyn" href="locations\settlements\to-be-fleshed\cuirefyn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cuirefyn</a>. Other storm refugees from <a data-href="Sauztein Geb" href="locations\settlements\to-be-fleshed\sauztein-geb.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sauztein Geb</a> and <a data-href="Irrhilm" href="locations\settlements\to-be-fleshed\irrhilm.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Irrhilm</a> discovered a large cavern below the <a data-href="Glistening Canopy" href="locations\landforms\glistening-canopy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Glistening Canopy</a>, where a stream empties into the caverns below. The appeal of this location was not only its access to relatively fresh water, but also the occasional shafts of sunlight that would reach through the Tenechronian storm clouds and down the stream entrance. This settlement would become a permanent extension of the modern city of <a data-href="Vrellyn" href="locations\settlements\the-verdant-city\vrellyn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vrellyn</a>.

Hellhaven is a sprawling city located at the eastern edge of <a data-href="Loierr Fenest" href="locations\regions\loierr-fenest.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Loierr Fenest</a>, where the fjord meets the <a data-href="Windbor Coast" href="locations\regions\windbor-coast.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Windbor Coast</a>. Founded in 1933, it became the epicenter of human theocracy, built upon the arrival of both humans and their god. The city serves as both a seat of power and a beacon of divine influence, with towering temples and dark spires dominating the skyline. Hellhaven’s streets are a mix of industrialization, religious fervor, and societal control, reflecting both the power of <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a> and the struggles of those living under his rule. Despite its oppressive atmosphere, Hellhaven remains a thriving hub of political and religious activity, drawing citizens and refugees alike seeking to live under the strict doctrine of <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>.
Hellhaven’s history is one of divine governance, military dominance, and a slow shift from the natural to the imposed. Once, the land was fertile and lush, but now it bears the scars of overuse and divine exertion. The city's buildings rise tall, made from black stone and wrought iron, often shrouded in a perpetual haze from residual Tenechronian magic that permeates the air.
Hellhaven is considered a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Settlement Classification Chart > ^bafa77" data-href="Settlement Classification Chart#^bafa77" href="meta\settlement-classification-chart.html#^bafa77" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Metropolis</a>.


Dark and Heavy: The air is thick with a sense of saltwater and incense, accompanied by the constant hum of religious rituals. The scent of burning offerings lingers in every corner, and the oppressive weight of divine oversight hangs over the city like a perpetual storm cloud. 

Devout and Subjugated: The citizens of Hellhaven live under a strict theocracy, their lives governed by <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>’s will. Religion and governance are inseparable, and almost every aspect of daily life is influenced by the city’s devout clergy. Despite this, there are murmurs of dissent among the more oppressed and disenfranchised groups, though open rebellion is rare due to the constant surveillance and control of the Inquisitors.<br>
Resilient but Fearful: The people of Hellhaven have learned to live with fear and reverence, constantly watching their actions, thoughts, and words. The deep piety instilled by the church is a double-edged sword—while it provides a sense of purpose and unity, it also stifles any attempts at self-expression or deviation from the divine law.<br>
Class Divisions: The city is deeply divided into classes, with the clergy and military occupying the highest echelons, while the common folk serve in subjugation to <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>'s divine will. The lower classes are relegated to menial tasks, working the factories and serving the wealthy, while the elite enjoy the privileges of power and influence.

Enforced Piety: Hellhaven is renowned for its unwavering dedication to <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>. Its citizens are constantly reminded of their place within the divine order, with the clergy acting as the primary enforcers of religious law. The Inquisitors, a military and religious police force, patrol the city, ensuring that no one deviates from the prescribed teachings and practices.<br>
Cultural Repression: Hellhaven’s culture is one of strict obedience to <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>’s will. Festivals and celebrations are rare, often occurring only during holy days or the anniversaries of significant religious events. Even then, they are imbued with solemnity and reverence, lacking the joy or exuberance found in other cities. Secretive underground movements occasionally attempt to overthrow the established order, but they are always stamped out swiftly by the ruling authorities.<br>
Power Struggles: While outwardly Hellhaven appears unified under the rule of <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>, there are political struggles between various factions of the clergy and military. These factions vie for influence and power, and while they may outwardly present a united front, there are deep fractures within the system that often lead to covert power struggles.<br>
Religious Sanctity: Despite its oppressive nature, Hellhaven is a pilgrimage site for those seeking divine enlightenment or wishing to prove their devotion to <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>. Pilgrims travel from across the land to pay homage to <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>’s temples, seeking blessings or guidance, often unaware of the city’s darker underbelly.
<br>Residents
Hellhaven is a city of devout followers and those desperate enough to seek refuge within its walls. Its population is primarily composed of humans, with a significant number of military personnel, clergy, and administrative officials. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Concordat of Chains" data-href="Concordat of Chains" href="organizations\concordat-of-chains.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Concordat of Chains</a> holds the most power, serving as both enforcers of divine law and elite military agents. The lower classes often live in fear, working in the factories or serving the clergy in menial ways.
Some come to Hellhaven out of necessity—many by birth, others by the will of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Concordat of Chains" data-href="Concordat of Chains" href="organizations\concordat-of-chains.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Concordat</a>, and some seeking salvation or answers from <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>. However, dissent is brewing beneath the surface. Underground movements and secret alliances work to resist the city’s divine control, though they are largely unsuccessful due to the ever-watchful eye of the <a data-href="Creosmagi" href="organizations\creosmagi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Creosmagi</a>.
While Hellhaven is a city of faith, it is also a place of secrecy, danger, and political intrigue, where the line between devotion and manipulation is often blurred.

<br>History and Lore
The history of Hellhaven is closely tied to the city’s foundation being built on a newfound gift of calming storms; Gellhafn. Over time, Gellhafn became a mercantile giant, but its power base later shifted from a port town to a sprawling city-state ruled by the clergy and military.
During the later years of the city’s formation, tensions arose between the mercantile elites and the <a data-href="Concordat of Chains" href="organizations\concordat-of-chains.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Concordat of Chains</a>, both seeking to claim authority of Gellhafn. These tensions came to a head during after The Dread, when Gellhafn’s political climate shifted to give credit to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Hellhapfen Governance and Power > ^abc6e7" data-href="Hellhapfen Governance and Power#^abc6e7" href="locations\settlements\haven-of-hale\subpages\hellhapfen-governance-and-power.html#^abc6e7" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Creed of Blinding Light</a>, now willing to believe that a higher power was communicating through global catastrophe to express dissent about magical regulation.
Despite these challenges, Gellhafn become Hellhaven, who still survives, though city life is constricted through both religious fervor and mercantile control. The city’s infrastructure became more complex, with the creation of the <a data-href="Creosmagi" href="organizations\creosmagi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Creosmagi</a> as both a religious police force and a military arm of <a data-href="The Lord" href="pantheon\domains\the-lord.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Lord</a>’s divine will. Today, Hellhaven stands as a symbol of divine rule and unwavering order, although beneath its holy exterior lies a web of political intrigue and hidden rebellion.

<br>History and Lore
 The first settlers of the area were further south, along the border of <a data-href="Hly'draug" href="locations\regions\hly'draug.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hly'draug</a> during the <a data-href="Gnosichron" href="lore\time\eras\gnosichron.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gnosichron</a>. Before the swamp was infested by infection, it was a thriving ecosystem of medicinal flora and awakened fauna. In fact, it was one of the few locations in which the ancestors of the ancient race of treants resided. Their collective wisdom of the area attracted druidic priests and healers, whose services attracted the accumulation of a community.
  The proximity to the swamp during the initial period of infection caused there to be an outbreak of <a data-href="The Plague" href="The Plague" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Plague</a>, which is an early iteration of the symptoms occurring from fungal infection from the <a data-href="Kagecombs" href="locations\regions\kagecombs.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kagecombs</a>. The settlement was quarantined and abandoned, leaving the meager few who appeared to be uninfected to find shelter within the <a data-href="Glistening Canopy" href="locations\landforms\glistening-canopy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Glistening Canopy</a>. The ancient treants were unable to escape with the rest of the town, but they imparted a final incantation unto the druids, who would later use it to reinforce the <a data-href="Glistening Canopy" href="locations\landforms\glistening-canopy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Glistening Canopy</a> from the spread of the <a data-href="Hly'draug" href="locations\regions\hly'draug.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hly'draug</a>. 
  This settlement was abandoned a second time during the <a data-href="Tenechron" href="lore\time\eras\tenechron.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tenechron</a>. Most residents found their way towards settlements far away from old <a data-href="Vrellyn" href="locations\settlements\the-verdant-city\vrellyn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vrellyn</a>, including a large group that traveled northwest to find the <a data-href="Kagecombs" href="locations\regions\kagecombs.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Kagecombs</a> marshland below <a data-href="Cuirefyn" href="locations\settlements\to-be-fleshed\cuirefyn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cuirefyn</a>.

The appeal of this location was not only its access to relatively fresh water, but also the occasional shafts of sunlight that would reach through the Tenechronian storm clouds and down the stream entrance.

 <br>Regaining Humanity

Transformation Boons:<br>
Your time in death has given you resistance to poison and cold damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition. Maintaining a connection to the afterlife, undead creatures do not perceive you as hostile. Your body no longer requires sleep during a long rest, only needing an 8 hour period of light activity in order to recuperate.
Your ghastly visage gives you advantage on any Charisma(Intimidation) checks against creatures that are not undead. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead.
Transformation Impairment:<br>
Being so new to the land of the living, you can maintain nothing more but a loose grip on life. Your sickly pale skin, and emaciated body is off-putting to any that see you, there is something clearly unnatural with your form. You have disadvantage on any Charisma(Persuasion) checks with any creatures that are not undead. Your memory of life before death is fuzzy and vague, you have disadvantage on any Intelligence(History) checks regarding your previous life.
You ride the line between life and death and have disadvantage on death saving throws, and are considered undead when considering any spells or effects that affect undead creatures. Being undead, you share some of their weaknesses. Whenever you are dealt radiant damage, you must succeed a DC20 Constitution Saving Throw, or take double damage. Your body never truly dies but becomes a "Drowned Blade". Your soul is trapped within your mortal form, conscious and aware, but unable to control your actions.

Transformation Boons:<br>
You still reserve some powers from death giving you resistance to poison damage. Your body only requires 8 hours of light activity to gain the benefits of a long rest. If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point. You still look incredibly sickly and have advantage on Charisma(Intimidation) checks against creatures that are not undead.
Transformation Impairments:<br>
Your skin starts to gain some color, and your body gains some weight. But you still look incredibly sickly to most people you encounter, a trained eye can still recognize there is something unnatural about your life. You are still considered undead when any spells or effects that affect undead are active. Details of your past life are still murky and hazy giving you disadvantage on Intelligence(history) checks regarding your previous life. When taking radiant damage make a DC15 Constitution Saving throw or take double damage. Your body never truly dies but becomes a "Drowned Assassin". Your soul is trapped within your mortal form, conscious and aware, but unable to control your actions.

Transformation Boons:<br>
Your body still maintains a resistance to poison damage, from your time in death. If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point. Your frame is no longer sickly thin, and most of the color has returned to your skin. You no longer appear as if you have come back from death.
Transformation Impairments:<br>
You still share some weaknesses of undead and must succeed a DC10 Constitution Saving throw or take double damage, when dealt radiant damage. You are still considered undead for the purpose of any spells or effects that affect undead. Your body never truly dies but becomes a "Drowned Master". Your soul is trapped within your mortal form, conscious and aware, but unable to control your actions.

Transformation Boons:<br>
You are no longer just living, you have a solid grasp on life, and have become more than a mere mortal. You have kept a resistance to poison damage from your time of death. Your hold on life is so strong you have gained an advantage on death saving throws. If you roll a natural 20 on a death saving throw, your hit points increase to 1, and gain temporary HP equal to half your hit point total. You are able to sense any undead within 50 feet of you, and you understand their weak points and deal an extra 2d12 damage when attacking them.
You have become in tune with your past life and have advantage on ant Intelligence(History) checks regarding your past life. You age at half the pace that is normal for your race, and when the time comes that you should die, both your body and soul are able to pass away normally and find peace.

 <br>Hello son,<br>Despite the unfortunate news you bring, it is always a blessing to hear from you. We have gotten word of what happened at the inn nearby, and are glad that you were not among those harmed. <br>You don't need to apologize to us, Norwick. I'm afraid we are the ones who have failed you. We should have told you about your grandparents. We hoped your grandfather's illness wouldn't affect you just as it seemed to have not affected your mother.<br>We are proud of you for taking it upon yourself to support those whose ambitions are well-meaning. You have always known how to find your place in a cause you believe in.<br>We appreciate the gold dragons as support, but you needn't worry about our financial state. We assure you we will be safe here in Neverwinter while you are off adventuring. All we ask that you send back to us are continued letters describing your stories on the road and how you are doing.<br>And whatever you do, do NOT go to Luskan. Only trouble awaits you there.<br>Love,<br>

The gang re-covers their plan

<br>
Tank and Norwick go to mayor

<br>give him gun
<br>Norwick shook his hand
<br>asked about why he wanted it
<br>Wraith stays behind to spy on manor


<br>
Split into teams to watch for gun leaving

<br>
Tank and Allie stayed at tavern to watch kidnapped guard

<br>
Droop goes missing

<br>
Everyone else goes to spy on manor

<br>Leandra and Brighton double back because not good stealth, go long route


<br>
Dyranielle uses locate object on the gun, senses it under the manor, suddenly goes missing

<br>
Leandra and Brighton join back up with the group after having a conversation about Leandra's dream

<br>
Wraith and her wards to a little recon

<br>Wraith fade away into the basement, gun is not there
<br>weird dolls and clay figurines everywhere


<br>
Wait around for awhile, see nothing, decide to go back to the tavern and re-group

<br>
FOUR GROUPS

<br>team distraction

<br>Tank
<br>Leandra
<br>Allie


<br>team sneak

<br>Wraith - ring
<br>Dyranielle - ring
<br>Norwick - shed


<br>team watch

<br>Moony
<br>Anderson


<br>team guard

<br>Drakkon




<br>
Distraction goes in to talk to the mayor (we know he's not there)

<br>
Norwick goes into the shed and finds a trap door

<br>
Wraith and Dyranielle realize they need the password (need the sending stone from Norwick to ask Tank if he got it)

<br>
They follow Norwick down the hole, catch up get the stone, Norwick keeps going, Wraith and Dyranielle get the password and sneak in

<br>
Norwick finds out the path just leads out into the woods, turns and jogs back

<br>
Team distraction finally gets to meet with the mayor, team stealth (minus Norwick) disguised as guards protecting him

<br>
Things get tense in the manor, the Mayor reads Tanks mind, who senses&nbsp; this and realizes that the mayor's not telling the entire truth. The party becomes violent,&nbsp; Leandra casts chaos bolt and alerts half the town to our presence. The Mayor casts darkness and flees, disappearing to all who were there to witness.

<br>
We fight the guards, the mayor gets away, everyone but Drakkon and Droop are in the manor. The party loots the two unconscious guards of their rings and elven chain.

<br>
We seal off all the entrances to prevent guards getting in

<br>
Tank searches the house, finds the stairs down, and eventually finds an active teleportation circle on the bottom floor. The others follow, besides Leandra, Wraith, and Norwick keeping watch on the first floor.

<br>
Tank goes though the teleportation circle, get's put in the closet (homophobic)

<br>
Tank tries to leave the closet but runs back in after seeing a spirit woman

 <br>Session Date: 12/2/23<br>
Game Date: 8th of Leaffall, 1512<br>
<br>
The party meets an old grizzled wizard man, name Aeloni Cosmo

<br>they offer to give them contents of a bag (unknown) if we help them find an arcane structure in the Evermoors, on our way to Silverymoon
<br>We agree


<br>
Ophal gives Norwick a gift from the town for helping

<br>preserved food worth 10 days ration
<br>5 gp worth of copper and silver


<br>
start to turn in for the night

<br>Norwick goes to patrol the town one last time
<br>Comes across Torisen attempting to fix the Shrine of Luck to give offerings to the fae
<br>Offers to help clean it up by fixing some of the heavier portions


<br>
Now the 9th of Leaffall, 1512!

<br>The sky is dark, but the stars are out :)


<br>
Meet in the Manor to find a dark room, we all hold hands and Cosmo does some magic stuff with a watch he said can transport us very quick

<br>wind starts to blow as we rise from the ground and start to spin
<br>flashes and bangs and we are sent sprawling out on the ground
<br>now in the bottom of a deep canyon, the sky is bright, and looks yellow as sand and debris blow overhead


<br>
Cosmo sends his pigmy owl familiar, Pablo, to try and fly up to gauge where we are. He is unsuccessful.

<br>
One way of the canyon collapses leaving only one way to move forward

<br>
walk for about half an hour before coming across a pile of mixed mud, bones, and blood.

<br>
Norwick tries to skirt around it after it seemingly does nothing, but Torisen grabs and pulls on the bone. It begins to move and shift forming 4 mud zombies.

<br>
The party battles the mud zombies back, but Norwick briefly looses control. There's a failed attempt by Selakiir to grapple him with Vaecrix, but luckily Brighton charms him just long enough to get him to calm down.

<br>
After some more analysis of where we are, and the realization that here has no North, we concluded that we had ended up in the elemental place of earth.

<br>
Pallabar continued down the canyon, and the rest followed. Eventually coming to a sharp turn and a dead end. Pallabar reached out and touched the wall. Hir eye's began to glow silver and the ground began to shake. Ze turned to Norwick and smiled before the ground collapsed swallowing the party. Tumbling around in the dark before being plopped just outside of Settlestone, where we initially intended to go.

<br>
Norwick asked Pallabar what ze had done to be able to do that, and why hir eyes turned silver, but ze seemed confused saying they just followed the same magic they saw when we teleported there. No one else saw anything similar.

 <br>Session Date: 1/15/24<br>
Game Date: 29th of The Rotting, 1512<br>
<br>After a brief look around our surroundings, we have concluded that it is now mid fall, specifically the 29th of The Rotting.
<br>Many fey beings have camped outside the town of settle stone, a trading point of mithril hall.

<br>A rot has infected their home in the High Forest, leaving them to be refugees
<br>Definitely totally not Alani, we super don't need to be worried about The Beast right now


<br>Cosmo runs about to the gates of Settle stone, claiming that his mother is dyeing inside and we urgently need to get medicine to her.
<br>We hear of a Dryad that's looking for help to restore her home
<br>We manage to get through customs by smuggling all of our arcane items in a bag of holding, hidden amongst the folds of Pallabar's clothes

<br>hir bag of sun flower seeds scared everyone


<br>Cosmo takes Norwick on a side quest to steal 300gp worth of gems

<br>Sparkle and Shine, a gem shop owned by Gene an old dwarf
<br>Cosmo turns Norwick invisible, and he jumps through a small opening in a window
<br>Pablo (now a crow) starts making a bunch of mud zombie noises
<br>Gene runs out, locks the door, and goes to get the city guards
<br>Norwick grabs 9 gems worth roughly 50gp each
<br>Pablo starts making rat noises, and makes Gene look silly in front of the guards
<br>Norwick jumps back out the window, and goes to find Selakiir.


<br>Selakiir, Brighton, and Leandra decide to go scamming

<br>they find a hot orc woman, who owns a nick knack shop
<br>Scam her into buying an egg for way too much
<br>She leads them to a well that goes down into a magical black market
<br>Norwick comes up behind Selakiir (still invisible) and jumps on him
<br>Leandra tells Norwick "Cosmo went that way", he believes her and jogs off on his merry little way
<br>Vaycrix scares the hell out of the guard
<br>They all enter the well on Vaycrix's back


<br>Torisen goes to sell some extra supplies, gives Pallabar his short sword
<br>Tank and Pallabar go enjoy dwarfish culture (get hammered) and go window shopping
<br>Eventually Torisen, Tank, Pallabar, Cosmo, and Norwick all find each other. Norwick brings them to the well.

<br>Cosmo goes in the bag of holding and Tank just jumps down 40 feet (stupid)
<br>Pallabar climbs on Norwick's back, he slides down the well and drops Pallabar off
<br>Norwick climbs back up the well, Torisen gets back on his back, he slides back down
<br>Norwick is very tired, and still very bloodied from the Zombies. Torisen heals him :)


<br>Everyone Goes Shopping!
<br>Highlights

<br>Leandra gets a replacement eye and a flying broomstick
<br>Cosmo steals a wand of wonder and gets chased by a guard, he gets away
<br>A guard tries to take Norwick into custody. Norwick gives his rebrand ring as a bribe, the guard tries. They just gets shoved off.
<br>Tank buys an enchantment to make his armor smell like lemons (wait 5 days then come back)

<br>he tells them to send it to Edward


<br>Brighton sees a vision and is drawn to a displacer beast kitten
<br>Norwick sells of the extra 3 gems, and finally gets a good map :)

<br>
Pablo comes back with a message from the Dryad, telling us to come to her to exchange some information

<br>
We make it out of the city (Cosmo hides in the Bag of Holding) without much suspicion. We said that Cosmo is staying inside with his sick mother. *cough *cough

Game Date: The Feast of the Moon, 1512<br>
<br>
The party continues trekking through the swamp, after awhile come along the coast line of some murky water. Leandra and Pablo fly out over the water to get a sense for how easy it would be to cross. Leandra spots some bubbles coming up from just under the surface of the water, and starts speeding back to the group to get away. I giant frog, with bat like wings emerges from the water and swallows Leandra whole.

<br>Combat :D
<br>We all start trudging through the water to try and keep up
<br>Cosmo casts jump on Norwick so he can bound on over
<br>After some struggle Brighton shoots the frog out of the sky.... and Leandra with it.
<br>Just as we thought it was almost over a large troll snuck up behind the rear of the group, meaning the front had to turn and sprint back over.
<br>Selakiir, Norwick, and Pallabar  all go down due to pustules erupting from the trolls back.

<br>When Selakiir went down Pallabar charged at it, hir eyes turning Silver and hir voice booming loud and low.

<br>
After the fight we take a short rest to regain our bearings, and Cosmo begins crafting a large raft.

<br>
Norwick asks Pallabar out of concern about hir glowing eyes, but ze don't notice when it happens, or know why. For the time being seem relatively unconcerned with figuring it out.

<br>
Norwick, Torisen, and Pallabar start making flash cards to help teach Pallabar fighting terms.

<br>
long rest!

<br>
Tank Vision

<br>uhhhhhh chased by faithful, Norwick is Tyr, Selakiir is someone with antlers, and Leandra is someone else?


<br>
Leandra Vision

<br>Mouse


<br>
Selakiir Vision

<br>the water is obsidian, he's goin in circles, until he just walks backwards. Sees the beast in the tree and tries to heal it.


<br>
Norwick vision

<br>
Norwick wakes up submerged, water filling his lungs. He surges up breaking out of the water, and sees that the fog has dissipated and that the raft and his friends are gone. In the distance there is a small island with a sickly willow tree standing alone on it.

<br>
Staying low, they slowly swim over to the island. Once making land they begin to look around and call out but they see no one there. He roams around for a minute attempting to get his bearings, crouching back down by the shore and splashes water onto his face. He looked down at his hands, in horror, covered in blood, a coppery taste sits upon his tongue, and a blood curdling scream behind him. Before he even has the time to turn around he's submerged underwater.

<br>
Emerging again from the water, Norwick sputtered and spat. They looked out again to see the island with the tree in the distance. He took a second to catch his breath before again carefully approaching the island. It again appeared empty, he wandered around looking for any sign of life, when a small hole in the roots caught his eye. He reached his hand in and found a small stone carving of a mouse, he gazed at it confused when he again heard a scream behind him. When he turned the stone slipped from his hand and hit the ground, the sound of a neck cracking rang out.

<br>
Water again filled his vision as he once again fought his way to the surface. Gasping he emerged and looked around to the same view as before. As he again approached the island he saw that this time he was not alone a cloaked figure sat beneath the tree by a small fire. Norwick approached the figure asking what was happening and if they were responsible, and grew angry when the figure did not reply. As he got closer and angrier, the figure quickly stood up and turned, it was Leandra. They were asking where mousy was, and that they could not find them. Norwick assured that Mousey must be somewhere near and began looking. Leandra went to the hole he found the stone in and collapsed on the ground.

<br>
Norwick asked if she was okay, but her eyes were filled with tears as Mousey's limp body was held in her hands. She turned to Norwick yelling at him, blaming him for Mousey's death, that he killed  them. Norwick tried to calm her, but his vision turned red, his skin began to rip and tear. He choked out, "Run!", before everything went dark, and water surrounded him.

<br>
Norwick for a moment stayed under the water, trying to calm his brain and his breath, before emerging from again, gasping for air. The moon shone overhead and on the shore of the island saw a group gathered carrying torches. He slowly moved around to the other side of the island, then going ashore. They slowly approached the group, but couldn't escape the feeling that they're being watched, on the edge of his vision he could have sworn the moon had blinked, but looking directly it remained normal.

<br>
"Who are you? What's going on?", Norwick shouted at the sky, but there was no response. 

<br>
It caught the attention of the group though, and they began to approach. As they got closer Norwick began to recognize the faces of his party members, all except for Leandra. For a moment he felt relief at seeing his friends but then Tank spoke. "You can't be here Norwick, it's too dangerous, you're too dangerous."

<br>
Norwick pleaded that he tried to tell Leandra to flee, that something was wrong, that this isn't real. But red filled his vision, his heart beat quickened, and the taste of blood on his tongue.

<br>
Norwick woke up underwater, and emerged again to see the island in the distance. A looming figure watched him, waiting for him along the shore, with arms too long, flesh torn, and wild eyes. It was himself. Norwick charged the beach determined to take the monster down, but he was torn to shreds.

<br>
Again, he found himself submerged underwater. What awaited for him was different this time though, the sky was red, the water turned to blood. There was still the island with the Willow tree, empty. Norwick swam up on to the island, feeling watched. He looked up at the stark white moon and called out "I'm done with this game, whatever you're trying to do just come out and face me. I can do this all day!" For a moment there was silence, then a rumbling in the distance, that quickly turned to a roar that filled his head, so deafening he felt like his skull might split in two. He looked out and in the distance he saw a 4-armed beast advancing towards him, causing a wave of blood to surge before it. Norwick stood paralyzed as it approached, screaming, the wave of blood overtook him and he once again found himself submerged underwater.

<br>
Something about the moon crying and blood rain

<br>
Norwick broke the surface, the fog had returned and the raft was just within reach. He hauled himself back on, and found himself amongst his friends again.



<br>
Cosmo vision

<br>"I killed it"
<br>"tree"
<br>Faye - "I have no idea what JP means by that"


<br>
Once everyone awoke from their visions, and got their bearings again they continued moving forward until the reached an island with a large sickly willow tree. They began searching around for what to do next, investigating the tree and trying to piece together details of their dreams.

<br>
They all return to the hole in the roots and look inside but can't make it far. Norwick attempts to stick his hand in but can't reach anything. Leandra sends Mousey in, but no one can follow. Selakiir beast shapes into a spider and begins to go inside.

 <br>Session Date: 6/13/24<br>
Game Date: 1st of Deep Winter<br>Spiderman (Selakiir) journeys deeper into the hole, and notices various fungal growths within the tree, the seem to pulse like a heartbeat. Further in, he came to a hollow in the tree, about the size to fit a person, and a strange blue growth emitting puffs of spores.<br>Selakiir unshifted, and attempted to remove the growth, but cut just too deep, it recoiled away from him as a thick puff came from the shrooms. Selakiir's head spun and he steadied himself against the side of the bark, when two milky white eyes appeared in front of him, before quickly blinking and disappearing again. He yelled out "Oh shit!", before the monster appeared on the outside of the tree.<br>It moved in and out of the ground, emitting puffs of poisonous spores and tearing into the party. Cornered on the beaches, the beast emitted a puff at Norwick, causing him to attack become confused, and attack anyone close to the tree. Killing Lark, and hurting Brighton. In retaliation Brighton quickly hold person-ed him.<br>The battle continues, blows being hit at one another, Tank spews acid at the growth, Cosmo creates a wall of fire burning it, but catching Norwick in the crossfire. Taking the advantage, the monster wrapped Norwick in vines and pulled him into the water infecting him with a fungal growth and lowering his intelligence. Leandra had some quick thinking and pulled Norwick out from underwater with her broom and quickly healed him, but he was still charmed, and continued attacking.<br>With one final strike Pallabar managed to destroy the dryad, leaving the party to deal with Norwick. Selakiir attempted to hit him with a darklight but it was not enough to subdue him, Norwick quickly countered and struck him with his axe, before Leandra flew up behind him and punched him in the back of the head (non-lethally)<br>The party buries Norwick's body under ground juuuuust in case, and goes off to investigate more. They casted speak with dead on the remains of the monster.<br>Are you the real Lotherian?<br>
<br>New separate Druid from the same tree<br>
How do we restore the tree?
<br>we interrupted a ritual that would have restored it to "greatness" (different views on the meaning restored)<br>
What "us" do you mean?
<br>We are the Amaurycos we are the rot in the ground, we have been released.<br>
How did you and your like get here?
<br>None like me, I was created by a monster, she left me here
<br>"The Everrot"<br>
I want to learn more about the Everrot, can you tell me?
<br>Tree has been infected with Amaurycos, they were the pin that held them there

 <br>
<br>Six people all received letters from their mysterious blackmailer, inviting them to a manor deep in the Trollbark forest on the 29th of The Claw of Storms, 1385.
<br>They all arrive one by one

<br>Maestro Mustard arrives first, no complications - leaves his horse untied outside
<br>Detective Chimera is second - tied his horse outside
<br>Lord Blight - arrived in a carriage, got dropped off and went inside
<br>Sister Sable walked fell and fell into the mud
<br>General Direwolf also walked, but managed to make it safely


<br>All the guests were greeted at the door by the butler, and escorted into the library to converse

<br>the maestro had.... a lot of water
<br>Lord Blight and Sister Sable seem to recognize each other


<br>The Guests are all escorted to the dining hall

<br>big elaborate table full of various foods
<br>Professor Persimmon arrived late, his horse broke down, and HHH had to bring in a replacement
<br>Once all the guests have arrived, the final guest comes in, introducing himself as Mr. Mimic


<br>Everyone goes into the study

<br>The butler reveals that Mr.Mimic was all of their blackmailers and sets the trap
<br>The butler crushes a black stone in the palm of his hand and the room goes dark
<br>Lights come back on and Mr.Mimic is dead


<br>Everyone agrees to lock their weapons in a vault, and to keep the key up in the chandelier
<br>There's a knock at the door, a young half-orcish woman was bucked off her horse on her way from Daggerford to Baldur's Gate, came looking for refuge. Sister Sable took the Professors horse, gave it to her, and told her to get as far away from there as possible.
<br>The ask if there's anyone else left in the manor, the butler says there's only the cook, Eke
<br>everyone said they have OCD😠 (CUZ THEY DO), lies
<br>The gang decides to split up and search the house

<br>The Butler stays in the grand hall to watch the key
<br>The Detective and Lord Blight Search the cellar
<br>Sister Sable and the General take Eke to search the second floor
<br>Maestro Mustard and Professor Persimmon search the attic


<br>Lord Blight and Detective Chimera see glowing red eyes in the forest, and find a wine bottle from the Crimson Fruit in the basement, with a note "From a Friend"
<br>Sister Sable activated her corkscrew and told them to go up to General Direwolf, once they go there she casted command on them to "Prick", instantly killing General Direwolf
<br>Sister Sable then comes up behind Eke and grabs them and immediately starts screaming about them killing the general
<br>People get Sister Sables side of the story but Eke is too freaked out to say much of anything
<br>Eke passes out
<br>As a sign of good will Seltzer Stable lets everyone tie her up so she can't go anywhere, along with eke
<br>Knock at the door, they open it up, Theodoros comes in seeking help from the rain, his is initially locked in the library
<br>Detective Chimera and the Professor hide what's left of General Direwolf's supplies, and hide Mr.Mimic under a blanket on the couch
<br>Everyone goes into the Kitchen, untie Sister Sable and Eke
<br>Theodoros gets out, and finds them in the kitchen
<br>They try to pull off that this is just an escape room party, it half works, not really, only kind of sort of
<br>People go up to the second floor to try and do another escape room, while they're looking around stalling there's a loud crash of lighting from outside and all the lights go out
<br>The Butler alerts them to check the roof for access to the power supply mechanism
<br>Professor Persimmon, Maestro Mustard, and Lord Blight find a riddle on a plaque next to two sapphire nodes, directing them to the dragon-slaying painting

<br>"Seek the dragon-killer, they will provide the notes they seek"


<br>Sister Sable is on her way back from exploring the basement on her own when she intercepts Lord Blight and the Professor on their way to the painting
<br>The paining is torn up and searched, and eventually in the frame of the painting, they found a few notes carved in
<br>They go to the ballroom and play the notes, the instruments all come to life and start to play music, a sapphire stone encrusted in the ground starts to glow.
<br>The stone is taken to the roof and replaces the old cracked one, all the lights come back on
<br>Eke is found in the kitchen scared and freaked out after the lights go out, Sister Sable goes to the guest bedroom to investigate while everyone else attends to Eke.

<br>Tensions are beginning to run high and people start attacking each other
<br>Sister Sable finds a secret passage from the guest room to the kitchen, casts a spell on Professor Persimmon, almost killing him, then runs back downstairs
<br>Eke and the Professor are passed out Maestro Mustard is throwing pans at Theodorus it's absolute chaos, but eventually calms down again.


<br>Not long after there's another knock at the door, a silly little Firbolg dude showed up, AND NO ONE ASKED HIS NAME
<br>Sister Sable offers to take him up to the guest room and away from all the... action

<br>Sister Sable locks them in the room and attempts to first magically charm him into submission
<br>The magical charm fails, but her inherit ability doesn't, and he falls right into her trap
<br>Sister Sable gets him in the bed, before stabbing him in the eye and then using a fire whip to strangle him

 <br>The rope chaffed at my wrists as I half-stumbled, half-stepped down the stairs to the keep dungeons, propelled by the shoves of the mute city watch. Spiraling down and deeper, my hopes of making my way out plummet farther with each step. I am aware of the decreasing possibility of sneaking my way back up these steps without encountering a patrolling watchman as much as I am aware of the increasing amount of dirt, stone, and bedrock between me and the haven of the port city's alleyways and shadows cast by flickering streetlamps.
I've had many lessons describing the details of the prison's weaknesses, lessons that might have assured me enough to drive away the chills running down my neck if not for the fact that such weaknesses were so few and far between. Ever since the city watch, unsettling with their scarred throats and voiceless expressions, had come under the funding of the heretics that practically run the city now, their security has been improved tenfold, particularly in the area of anti-magic wards. Back at the guild I know a few scoundrels who had escaped from here before, but that was before the humans came with their savior complexes and higher-than-thou attitudes.
All I need to do is retrieve the artifact, then I'm out.
The revolution had acquired some "ammunition" towards our unwanted dictators, but soon after our base of operations was cracked down upon. Some suspect a rat, but many more are of a mind to focus on next steps, which is why I'm here, trudging over cold, unforgiving stone with an unreachable itch just below my right shoulder blade.
I rotate my shoulder uncomfortably as I'm led past rows of cells upon cells, some containing familiar faces, though not necessarily friendly ones. Some contain the disgruntled look of war heroes fallen from grace and memory. Others hide the quiet-types. I'll have to look out for those; I avert my attention as one flits their gaze above the rim of their book to catch me staring. Some cells don't have bars, where instead there are simply banded iron doors with slots for meager meal trays. The thought crosses my mind that these could either be where disciplined prisoners are sent, or could be that they were made special for a more sinister type of criminal.
"The city would be much more diverse if these folks were topside," I lean my head back to flash my teeth at one of the Watch. "Ever wonder if there's a reason why the tourists and travelers are always the ones who have the tendency towards disagreeing with your sponsor's rules?"]]></description><link>meta\inspiration\a-scoundrel-squandered.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Meta/Inspiration/A Scoundrel Squandered.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 20:58:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ideas and Inspiration]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>World is shaped like swiss cheese

<br>chasms


<br>Forgotten Realms Timeline Structure

<br>primordial vs gods war (Dawn War)
<br>dragons vs giants war (Days of Thunder)

<br>possibly ended by halflings waking sleeping gods


<br>(Age of Arcanum)
<br>until an age of humanity


<br>Crossing over with elemental plane

<br>sea level + or - 15 feet
<br>hole in the middle of the ocean
<br>ships need proper timing to be able to cross narrow channels


<br>Calendar based off forgotten realms

<br>rename months + holidays
<br>add ten-day names


<br>Pre-Feywild and shadow fell separation
<br>Several gods covering a domain, mortals gave one name

<br>Entropy
<br>fate
<br>darkness


<br>frog races exist because Feywild hasn't separated yet
<br>Gulf city is a very anti-arcane, empire that controls the gulf coast, technologically advanced big steampunk vibe
<br>{insert sea gods}'s kiss

<br>water flow changes due to plane of water crossing
<br>place where the water meets and crashes is really tumultuous
<br>god of eastern sea, god of western sea, this is where they meet and be gay, "Lover's Meet"
<br>when they meet and crash it's a good sign for romantic gestures, when they part it's best to hold off "Lover's Quarrel"


<br>Chasm in desert, magical darkness makes it impossible to see where it leads. Leaks of fiends escape from the hole suggest that it's the central battle ground for the Blood War.
<br>Tree on SE side, spongy to the touch and the source of the corruption of the surrounding marshlands. Appears to be a Willow tree, but the leaves are just tendrils of slime, constantly dripping. Some holy relic of an ancient Elven civilization? Gift from a god?

<br>most common summoned fiends are yugoloths


<br>Pine forest on the Eastern side, deep in the forest is an entrance to a cave system, leading into the underdark, and a certain tomb of horrors
<br>Somethin with these little guys, idk<br>

<br>Founding Magic

<br>Halflings - Artificing
<br>Draconic - Arcane practices
<br>Genasi - Druidic channeling
<br>Elves - Bardic naming


<br>War between the draconic, water elementals, and air elementals against the earth and fire elementals

<br>Sides are up for debate, it was def draconic vs. earth though
<br>We might not be doing this


<br>Technologically advanced city in the desert

<br>robots and magic and fun!

Each region has unique resources, dangers, and magical phenomena. <br><br>Travel between cities and settlements is dangerous due to the shadowdhavian and fey influences on the land and eldritch horrors, but trade, mutual defense, and politics weave complex relationships across Umbrea. <br>]]></description><link>meta\a-guide-to-umbrea.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Meta/A Guide to Umbrea.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:41:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Project Sigil]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br>It is cold and dry, the night is the most dangerous temperature-wise, which just happens to be the constant state of the sky. <br><br>*finger wag*<br><br><br><br>
The same "domains." From the DM perspective, the domains are a bunch of gods, including different race's interpretations of certain domains. Though the mainstream religions will often refer to a single pantheon with domains such as the <a href="obsidian:\\open?vault=Umbrea&amp;file=Pantheon%2FGods%2FThe Big Spider" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Weaver</a>, those domains can be made up of many different gods. When some cultures have different representations of those domains, a new divine spark brings light to another god to maintain that domain.<br>Essentially they are a bunch of departments with different representatives.<br>### Where/when/why do elves come to Umbrea?  ^e2217c<br>When: Elves came before many of the humanoid races evolved, before the <a data-href="Elementals" href="Elementals" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Elementals</a> invaded from the <a data-href="Prime Elemental Planes" href="Prime Elemental Planes" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Elemental Planes</a>. During their visit, the gods were dormant, and only the spirits of the land were present. These proved to be both welcoming and dangers to the elves, as they interacted with both light and dark spirits. Instances of the elves' interactions with light spirits are memorialized through monuments left by the elves, often stone shaped with natural magics. Monuments resulting from interactions with the dark spirits often function as warnings, but some even ward dark spirits away. These arcane relics are made of <a data-href="petrolune" href="lore\mechanics\petrolune.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">petrolune</a> and are powered by a combination of the Elves' astral infusion with the spiritual magic learned from the light spirits. These <a data-href="Elvish Monuments" href="Elvish Monuments" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Elvish Monuments</a> still stand today, and serve as an eerie reminder of the existence of otherworlds that dot the night sky.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The <a data-href="Desert City" href="Desert City" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Desert City</a> is a gnomish underground outpost that specializes in automaton defense systems, mostly out of necessity, since the exit from the <a data-href="Underdark" href="Underdark" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Underdark</a> that they emerged from is located in the <a data-href="Northern Desert" href="Northern Desert" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Northern Desert</a>.

Ever since the <a data-href="Desert City" href="Desert City" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Desert City</a> established a trade route with <a data-href="Hellhaven" href="locations\settlements\haven-of-hale\hellhaven.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hellhaven</a>, it has benefited from selling both its expertise in automatons for keeping the law, as well as allowed young artisans to branch out to further magical tinkering contraptions that are considered desirable by the ports and businesses within the city. Such prosperity has even allowed some <a data-href="Desert City" href="Desert City" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Desert City</a> residents to travel to <a data-href="Hellhaven" href="locations\settlements\haven-of-hale\hellhaven.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hellhaven</a>'s <a data-href="Great Library" href="Great Library" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Great Library</a> and research new engineering exploits.

The <a data-href="Great Library" href="Great Library" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Great Library</a> is also host to the current research project of an underground train system.

<br>With the trolley system has come tourists from southern cities, who bring with them a thirst for entertainment.

 <br>Appearance
Wind rolls over a hilly landscape, the brush whispers in a quivering dance. Thunderous roars rock the world like a storm as torrents of fire tumble out of jagged maws. The shrubs shift, staggering their movement across a scorched battlefield and break into a sprint as they reach a forest edge. Bush fronds fall from the muddied faces they covered, ropes binding the woody bundles and foliage to wrists now pumping in flight. Hand-spun clothes rustle underneath dried disguises but running steps fall silent, no matter the presence of the clamor of battle.<br>
A dark, curly-haired embroiderer works golden thread into a daughter's tunic. Glittering stalks of grain sprout from the neckline in a woven corona. Discrete threads trail underneath the fabric, their pattern and knots weaving a spell of luck between the threads. The embroiderer holds the finished garment up for rays of sunlight to pass through. Trails of lights spread over the threads, and wisp over the folds of the cloth, looping and spiraling over the left breast.<br>
Atop a cargo crate perches a bare-footed minstrel, one swinging in tempo as the crook of the other leg supports a drum with a pigskin stretched and pinned across the top. Minne Connyfer taps and flicks at her tantan with a song at her lips, amusement tugging at the corners of her mouth while she recites its bawdy lyrics. Her grin falters a moment as she scans the crowd upon the deck, her almond eyes falling upon a grey-hooded and thin figure lurking on the dock nearby with a sharp face and a piercing leer to match. Her hands trembled as the hooded figure boarded the ship, but her voice rang true and her song did not waver as they stepped slowly closer. They leaned in close enough for her to see the telltale scar across their throat of the silent <a data-href="Creosmagi" href="organizations\creosmagi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Creosmagi</a>. A white fishbone coin with the Spinster's eye engraved on either side flipped into the bowl set before her. She nodded at the figure as they gave her a squinting smirk before spinning away, robes trailing behind as they were swept away at a purposeful pace.
<br>History and Lore
The mulburrows live as a merry folk, though secluded from much of the other Umbrean societies. They began as a nomadic folk, during the era of war between dragons and giants, but have settled in a mountain valley held secret for generations. It is rare to find these folk outside of their green paradise, but it is well known that there is nearly always a mulburrow behind the greatest heroes and phenomena of yore.

<br>First humanoid race of Umbrea mmmmmmmm
<br>Originally discovered artisanal magic, by learning to tie spellcraft through physical manipulation such as sewing, cooking, painting, and weaving.

 <br>Appearance
"Do I... frighten you?" The flickering lenses of an android mask fizzle with each spoken syllable from its perch upon a workbench strewn with bolts, scrap plates, and cogs. On a desk nearby is an even more severe mess of notebooks and sheets filled with runic scrawling in Giant script; character sequences approximating the equation of transferrable learning; a formula for an artificial conscience. Perspiring and hunched above their notes, an engineer taps a marker upon the work desk wood incessantly, before straightening up and inscribing a final rune, a self-satisfied grin tugging at their mouth as their eyes flit to the disembodied automaton as it awaits the response to its query.
They trace the inner lining of the wig's scalp with an adhesive clay and firmly press it over their tattooed head. Scrutinizing their reflection in the mirror, they run a grey finger over their eyelids, leaving kohl shadow to contrast the russet irises scouring, emotionless, for unaccounted flaws. Picking up a thin-tipped brush from a stone vessel, they dip into flesh-colored paste and apply it over the slightest phantom of a scar apparent under layers of makeup. They needn't apply such detail to the rest of their appearance: donning a short-brimmed hat and a night jacket with trailing sleeves, they look back at the mirror as they slip on their velvet gloves. A ghostly visage dressed for the opera gazes back, its hair wispy and suspended in the silver-backed reflection. Squeezing their eyes shut, they flush the image from their mind and touch the brim of their hat against the streetlamps as they pull the door shut.  
Deer's antlers protrude from an otherwise indistinguishable tangle of ivy and thorn reaching to wrap the base of a tree. The keen eye can discern a head hung low, rest against the wooden chest of an abandoned woad well past its days of animation. Creeping mist brings the spreading swamp closer to the edge of this woods, and brings its waters' infestation of spores along with it. Seeping into the roots of the great tree, a network of fungal growths enter the husk and fill it with the sounds of life. A system of organic contraptions pump energy from its once rotting cavities to its primary limbs. The soft glow of bioluminescence fills the deer head's sockets, introducing new purpose to this discarded form. Thousands of discorporate voices hiss in unison a common objective: "Grow farther, and spread our unity. Let peace be discovered in symbiosis."
<br>History and Lore
Natural golems have been animated and sculpted by the druids of Umbrea for centuries, and many have tried to perfect the art. A certain pursuit of intelligence has led some of these golems to present a level of consciousness. This has been achieved in several different ways: perhaps a stray forest spirit was infused within the golem's form,&nbsp;maybe&nbsp;an ancient warden has been magically altered and improved over decades to result in a moment of "birth of&nbsp;awareness" in more recent years, or the biological nature of the golem's materials resulted in a collective consciousness between its myriad parts and components.
Spirit golems can come in all kinds of materials and origins. Most commonly, they are made in the image of leshen, the wardens of the wood and the Glistening Canopy. However some are animated nonliving material such as soil or stone, or even flesh, mimicking the more typical image of a golem brought to Umbrea by the humans of the Ark. More rarely, a spirit golem could be a feat of technology, perhaps even a mixture of spirit magics and cogwork from the gnomish city of <a data-href="Vergrenzig" href="locations\settlements\to-be-fleshed\vergrenzig.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vergrenzig</a>.
These construct-spirit hybrids are distinguished by their fresh perspective of the world, and their history of servitude. As the children of golems, these autonomous creatures are viewed as lesser servants who have little to no emotional capabilities. Any golems who act outside of a humanoid's orders are viewed as "rebellious" and "dangerous" and an "insult&nbsp;to the arcane".

 <br>Location and Description
A large coliseum located in the heart of the city, with large archways allowing hoards of spectators to enter through. Detailed stone work can be found on every wall and column, evoking ancient draconic imagery. The arena itself hosts rows upon rows of seating, enough to host thousands of attendants. High up there are various guest boxes reserved for the most wealthy members of draconic society. An announcer's box is amongst these, magically equipped to allow the users voice to be heard amongst the roaring crowds. 
At the center of this massive coliseum is a large circular arena with a sandy floor. Four bared entrances lead into the fighting pit, a large moat circling it, with draconic fountains jutting out of the walls. Small bridges with snake head railings allow the competitors passage to the center of the arena. Twelve fifty foot columns of rough stone topped with fire line up around the arena. Large stone crocodile statues, standing rearing on their hide quarters, provide platforms for competitors to take their starting positions on.  
Bellow the arena hosts the competitors, and their rooms for preparation. A vast armory of magical weaponry and tools are available to them. Along with medics and staff on hand to attend to any injuries that befall them while in the arena.
