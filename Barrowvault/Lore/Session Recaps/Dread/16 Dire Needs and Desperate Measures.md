- Pablo comes back with a message from the Dryad, telling us to come to her to exchange some information
- We make it out of the city (Cosmo hides in the Bag of Holding) without much suspicion. We said that Cosmo is staying inside with his sick mother. \*cough* \*cough* 
- We find the Dryad, she's sick and bedridden. She points out a spot on the map where the issues originated, and tells us to go there.
- She also mentions that The Beast has been spotted, uh oh

- Now The Feast of the Moon
- Continue into the Evermoors
- filled with thick fog that is easy to get mixed up in, keep running in to one another and doubting the path we're taking.
- A loud hum begins to surround us, we huddle closer together as giant dragon flies emerge from the thick fog
	- we beat the shit out of them
