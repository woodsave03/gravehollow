Session Date: 1/15/24
Game Date: 29th of The Rotting, 1512

- After a brief look around our surroundings, we have concluded that it is now mid fall, specifically the 29th of The Rotting.
- Many fey beings have camped outside the town of settle stone, a trading point of mithril hall.
	- A rot has infected their home in the High Forest, leaving them to be refugees
	- Definitely totally not Alani, we super don't need to be worried about The Beast right now
- Cosmo runs about to the gates of Settle stone, claiming that his mother is dyeing inside and we urgently need to get medicine to her.
- We hear of a Dryad that's looking for help to restore her home
- We manage to get through customs by smuggling all of our arcane items in a bag of holding, hidden amongst the folds of Pallabar's clothes
	- hir bag of sun flower seeds scared everyone
- Cosmo takes Norwick on a side quest to steal 300gp worth of gems
	- Sparkle and Shine, a gem shop owned by ~~Gene~~ an old dwarf
	- Cosmo turns Norwick invisible, and he jumps through a small opening in a window
	- Pablo (now a crow) starts making a bunch of mud zombie noises
	- Gene runs out, locks the door, and goes to get the city guards
	- Norwick grabs 9 gems worth roughly 50gp each
	- Pablo starts making rat noises, and makes Gene look silly in front of the guards
	- Norwick jumps back out the window, and goes to find Selakiir.
- Selakiir, Brighton, and Leandra decide to go scamming
	- they find a ~~hot~~ orc woman, who owns a nick knack shop
	- Scam her into buying an egg for **way** too much
	- She leads them to a well that goes down into a magical black market
	- Norwick comes up behind Selakiir (still invisible) and jumps on him
	- Leandra tells Norwick "Cosmo went that way", he believes her and jogs off on his merry little way
	- Vaycrix scares the hell out of the guard
	- They all enter the well on Vaycrix's back
- Torisen goes to sell some extra supplies, gives Pallabar his short sword
- Tank and Pallabar go enjoy dwarfish culture (get hammered) and go window shopping
- Eventually Torisen, Tank, Pallabar, Cosmo, and Norwick all find each other. Norwick brings them to the well.
	- Cosmo goes in the bag of holding and Tank just jumps down 40 feet (stupid)
	- Pallabar climbs on Norwick's back, he slides down the well and drops Pallabar off
	- Norwick climbs back up the well, Torisen gets back on his back, he slides back down
	- Norwick is very tired, and still very bloodied from the Zombies. Torisen heals him :)
- Everyone Goes Shopping!
- Highlights
	- Leandra gets a replacement eye and a flying broomstick
	- Cosmo steals a wand of wonder and gets chased by a guard, he gets away
	- A guard tries to take Norwick into custody. Norwick gives his rebrand ring as a bribe, the guard tries. They just gets shoved off.
	- Tank buys an enchantment to make his armor smell like lemons (wait 5 days then come back)
		- he tells them to send it to Edward
	- Brighton sees a vision and is drawn to a displacer beast kitten
	- Norwick sells of the extra 3 gems, and finally gets a good map :)
