Spiderman (Selakiir) journeys deeper into the hole, and notices various fungal growths within the tree, the seem to pulse like a heartbeat. Further in, he came to a hollow in the tree, about the size to fit a person, and a strange blue growth emitting puffs of spores.

Selakiir unshifted, and attempted to remove the growth, but cut just too deep, it recoiled away from him as a thick puff came from the shrooms. Selakiir's head spun and he steadied himself against the side of the bark, when two milky white eyes appeared in front of him, before quickly blinking and disappearing again. He yelled out "Oh shit!", before the monster appeared on the outside of the tree.

It moved in and out of the ground, emitting puffs of poisonous spores and tearing into the party. Cornered on the beaches, the beast emitted a puff at Norwick, causing him to attack become confused, and attack anyone close to the tree. Killing Lark, and hurting Brighton. In retaliation Brighton quickly hold person-ed him.

The battle continues, blows being hit at one another, Tank spews acid at the growth, Cosmo creates a wall of fire burning it, but catching Norwick in the crossfire. Taking the advantage, the monster wrapped Norwick in vines and pulled him into the water infecting him with a fungal growth and lowering his intelligence. Leandra had some quick thinking and pulled Norwick out from underwater with her broom and quickly healed him, but he was still charmed, and continued attacking.

With one final strike Pallabar managed to destroy the dryad, leaving the party to deal with Norwick. Selakiir attempted to hit him with a darklight but it was not enough to subdue him, Norwick quickly countered and struck him with his axe, before Leandra flew up behind him and punched him in the back of the head (non-lethally)

The party buries Norwick's body under ground juuuuust in case, and goes off to investigate more. They casted speak with dead on the remains of the monster.
