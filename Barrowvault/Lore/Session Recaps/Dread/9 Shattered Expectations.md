- Fought drow soldiers that invaded the Tresendar Manor
- Norwick killed a lot of people really brutally because... axe
- Tank and Norwick have really different backgrounds, and really different opinions on death and battle, argue ethics
- Moony met Peren, a Harper come to investigate the Redbrands and the Black Spider
- Norwick and Hoarfrost go back to town
	- on the way back see a crow fly out of a bush and suddenly die
		- Hoarfrost investigates the crow and gets a cold
		- no clear sign of death
	- Go to the Stonehill Inn, Norwick tells Ophal that the Redbrands were actually drow in disguise, and now no longer around, spread word around the time to try to stay inside and stay safe for the time being.
	- Picked up Drakkon again
	- Let go of the guard we kidnapped, tried to get him to try and save the town - don't think it'll work though, hopefully we got through to him though, his name was Dalinh
	- Meet everyone else and go back to town

- Pallabar notices one of the clay statues looks just like Ophal
- The gang deduces that there's enough of the clay statues to represent the whole town
- Norwick and Pallabar continue to search the shelves
- Leandra takes a nap on the floor
- Norwick finds the shattered clay figure, tries to piece it together, assumes it's Droop (2 on a Wisdom check) and has a breakdown, Brighton tries to help, comes to the same conclusion.
- Tank questions his life decisions
- Norwick's head ache ends, he picks himself up and decides he needs to avenge Droop
- Norwick asks Peren questions about the Black Spider and tries to brainstorm ideas to help the town once this is all over
