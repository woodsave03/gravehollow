Drakkon and Hoarfrost Missing

- Wake up and hear some shuffling outside
- Norwick checks and doesn't notice anything new
	- Like everyone else sees a minotaur skeleton amongst other things
	- Norwick gets absolutely ripped into (he's fine)
	- Eventually kill them
	- Tank puts new big ax in his bag
- Continue into the compound, come across a barricaded door
	- guarded by a team of bugbears, won't let us in
	- various failed attempts to break it down
	- at one point we take off the door handle
	- Norwick tries to talk them into letting us in (fails)
	- tries to break it down again
	- Selakiir gets them to let us in
- Continue into the compound, see lots of drow soldiers, and potential leads to the underdark
- Talk to some commanders, they mostly think we're just new and incompetent

- Go into a big dinner hall
	- omg Selakiir has a brother
	- his brother has droop enslaved in a trance
	- wants to overthrow the Drow Matriarchy, by manipulating surface leaders and having them go to war
		- Selakiir is trying to trust his brother
		- Norwick is against
		- Tank resolves to just kill them later if we wanna back out
		- everyone else seems fine-ish with it
- Agree to work together, maybe a little hesitantly
- potentially knows someone to help with Norwick's condition
- we get our effigies, tank has all them
- Slave droop was actually a doppelganger, droop was taking a nap in the lab
- NORWICK GETS GUN BACK!
