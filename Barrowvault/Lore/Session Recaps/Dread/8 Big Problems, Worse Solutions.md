- Tank and Allie stayed at tavern to watch kidnapped guard
- Droop goes missing
- Everyone else goes to spy on manor
	- Leandra and Brighton double back because not good stealth, go long route
- Dyranielle uses locate object on the gun, senses it under the manor, suddenly goes missing
- Leandra and Brighton join back up with the group after having a conversation about Leandra's dream
- Wraith and her wards to a little recon
	- Wraith fade away into the basement, gun is not there
	- weird dolls and clay figurines everywhere
- Wait around for awhile, see nothing, decide to go back to the tavern and re-group

- FOUR GROUPS
	- team distraction
		- Tank
		- Leandra
		- Allie
	- team sneak
		- Wraith - ring
		- Dyranielle - ring
		- Norwick - shed
	- team watch
		- Moony
		- Anderson
	- team guard
		- Drakkon

- Distraction goes in to talk to the mayor (we know he's not there)
- Norwick goes into the shed and finds a trap door
- Wraith and Dyranielle realize they need the password (need the sending stone from Norwick to ask Tank if he got it)
- They follow Norwick down the hole, catch up get the stone, Norwick keeps going, Wraith and Dyranielle get the password and sneak in
- Norwick finds out the path just leads out into the woods, turns and jogs back

- Team distraction finally gets to meet with the mayor, team stealth (minus Norwick) disguised as guards protecting him
- Things get tense in the manor, the Mayor reads Tanks mind, who senses  this and realizes that the mayor's not telling the entire truth. The party becomes violent,  Leandra casts chaos bolt and alerts half the town to our presence. The Mayor casts darkness and flees, disappearing to all who were there to witness.
- We fight the guards, the mayor gets away, everyone but Drakkon and Droop are in the manor. The party loots the two unconscious guards of their rings and elven chain.
- We seal off all the entrances to prevent guards getting in
- Tank searches the house, finds the stairs down, and eventually finds an active teleportation circle on the bottom floor. The others follow, besides Leandra, Wraith, and Norwick keeping watch on the first floor.
- Tank goes though the teleportation circle, get's put in the closet (homophobic)
- Tank tries to leave the closet but runs back in after seeing a spirit woman
