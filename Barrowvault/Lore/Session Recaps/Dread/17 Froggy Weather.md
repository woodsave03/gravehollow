Session Date: 1/27/24
Game Date: The Feast of the Moon, 1512

- The party continues trekking through the swamp, after awhile come along the coast line of some murky water. Leandra and Pablo fly out over the water to get a sense for how easy it would be to cross. Leandra spots some bubbles coming up from just under the surface of the water, and starts speeding back to the group to get away. I giant frog, with bat like wings emerges from the water and swallows Leandra whole.
	- Combat :D
	- We all start trudging through the water to try and keep up
	- Cosmo casts jump on Norwick so he can bound on over
	- After some struggle Brighton shoots the frog out of the sky.... and Leandra with it.
	- Just as we thought it was almost over a large troll snuck up behind the rear of the group, meaning the front had to turn and sprint back over.
	- Selakiir, Norwick, and Pallabar  all go down due to pustules erupting from the trolls back.
		- When Selakiir went down Pallabar charged at it, hir eyes turning Silver and hir voice booming loud and low.
		- Selakiir gets healed by Cosmo and some berries
		- Tank gets Pallabar up
		- Leandra helps Norwick
	- Tank and Norwick keep trying to push it away to stop killing us when it takes damage.
	- due to the blessings of THE GREAT GARLIC, we get some really solid hits on it, and Norwick delivers the final killing blow.

- After the fight we take a short rest to regain our bearings, and Cosmo begins crafting a large raft.
- Norwick asks Pallabar out of concern about hir glowing eyes, but ze don't notice when it happens, or know why. For the time being seem relatively unconcerned with figuring it out.
- Norwick, Torisen, and Pallabar start making flash cards to help teach Pallabar fighting terms.
- long rest!
