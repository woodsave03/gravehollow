	- begin to smell sulfur
	- a bubbling spot appears and begins moving about

- Leandra Vision
	- Mouse
- Selakiir Vision
	- the water is obsidian, he's goin in circles, until he just walks backwards. Sees the beast in the tree and tries to heal it.
- Norwick vision
	- Norwick wakes up submerged, water filling his lungs. He surges up breaking out of the water, and sees that the fog has dissipated and that the raft and his friends are gone. In the distance there is a small island with a sickly willow tree standing alone on it.
	
	- Staying low, they slowly swim over to the island. Once making land they begin to look around and call out but they see no one there. He roams around for a minute attempting to get his bearings, crouching back down by the shore and splashes water onto his face. He looked down at his hands, in horror, covered in blood, a coppery taste sits upon his tongue, and a blood curdling scream behind him. Before he even has the time to turn around he's submerged underwater.
	
	- Emerging again from the water, Norwick sputtered and spat. They looked out again to see the island with the tree in the distance. He took a second to catch his breath before again carefully approaching the island. It again appeared empty, he wandered around looking for any sign of life, when a small hole in the roots caught his eye. He reached his hand in and found a small stone carving of a mouse, he gazed at it confused when he again heard a scream behind him. When he turned the stone slipped from his hand and hit the ground, the sound of a neck cracking rang out.
	
	- Water again filled his vision as he once again fought his way to the surface. Gasping he emerged and looked around to the same view as before. As he again approached the island he saw that this time he was not alone a cloaked figure sat beneath the tree by a small fire. Norwick approached the figure asking what was happening and if they were responsible, and grew angry when the figure did not reply. As he got closer and angrier, the figure quickly stood up and turned, it was Leandra. They were asking where mousy was, and that they could not find them. Norwick assured that Mousey must be somewhere near and began looking. Leandra went to the hole he found the stone in and collapsed on the ground.
	
	- Norwick asked if she was okay, but her eyes were filled with tears as Mousey's limp body was held in her hands. She turned to Norwick yelling at him, blaming him for Mousey's death, that he killed  them. Norwick tried to calm her, but his vision turned red, his skin began to rip and tear. He choked out, "Run!", before everything went dark, and water surrounded him.

	- Norwick for a moment stayed under the water, trying to calm his brain and his breath, before emerging from again, gasping for air. The moon shone overhead and on the shore of the island saw a group gathered carrying torches. He slowly moved around to the other side of the island, then going ashore. They slowly approached the group, but couldn't escape the feeling that they're being watched, on the edge of his vision he could have sworn the moon had blinked, but looking directly it remained normal.

	- "Who are you? What's going on?", Norwick shouted at the sky, but there was no response. 
	
	- It caught the attention of the group though, and they began to approach. As they got closer Norwick began to recognize the faces of his party members, all except for Leandra. For a moment he felt relief at seeing his friends but then Tank spoke. "You can't be here Norwick, it's too dangerous, you're too dangerous."
	
	- Norwick pleaded that he tried to tell Leandra to flee, that something was wrong, that this isn't real. But red filled his vision, his heart beat quickened, and the taste of blood on his tongue.

	- Norwick woke up underwater, and emerged again to see the island in the distance. A looming figure watched him, waiting for him along the shore, with arms too long, flesh torn, and wild eyes. It was himself. Norwick charged the beach determined to take the monster down, but he was torn to shreds.

	- Again, he found himself submerged underwater. What awaited for him was different this time though, the sky was red, the water turned to blood. There was still the island with the Willow tree, empty. Norwick swam up on to the island, feeling watched. He looked up at the stark white moon and called out "I'm done with this game, whatever you're trying to do just come out and face me. I can do this all day!" For a moment there was silence, then a rumbling in the distance, that quickly turned to a roar that filled his head, so deafening he felt like his skull might split in two. He looked out and in the distance he saw a 4-armed beast advancing towards him, causing a wave of blood to surge before it. Norwick stood paralyzed as it approached, screaming, the wave of blood overtook him and he once again found himself submerged underwater.

	- Something about the moon crying and blood rain

	- Norwick broke the surface, the fog had returned and the raft was just within reach. He hauled himself back on, and found himself amongst his friends again.
- Cosmo vision
	- "I killed it"
	- "tree"
	- Faye - "I have no idea what JP means by that"
- Once everyone awoke from their visions, and got their bearings again they continued moving forward until the reached an island with a large sickly willow tree. They began searching around for what to do next, investigating the tree and trying to piece together details of their dreams.
- They all return to the hole in the roots and look inside but can't make it far. Norwick attempts to stick his hand in but can't reach anything. Leandra sends Mousey in, but no one can follow. Selakiir beast shapes into a spider and begins to go inside.
