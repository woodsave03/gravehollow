Selakiir and Leandra missing

- finish a short rest before heading into the portal
	- Moony has a seemingly disturbing dream, but won't talk about it
- use the disguise rings to make our selves all look like red brand guards
- go through the portal cross paths with a floating skeletal figure, that tells us to stop snooping around chests that aren't ours
- make our way through the hideout, encountering various things
	- weird mold
	- mosquito bats
	- weird old dwarf murals
- find a room full of old barrels good for any rests we may need
- fight some ghouls but one is unnoticed
- decide to push on before taking a rest
	- the remaining ghoul hid and came up from behind
	- walked into a room full of zombies and a flaming skull
