Session Date: 12/2/23
Game Date: 8th of Leaffall, 1512

- The party meets an old grizzled wizard man, name Aeloni Cosmo
	- they offer to give them contents of a bag (unknown) if we help them find an arcane structure in the Evermoors, on our way to Silverymoon
	- We agree
- Ophal gives Norwick a gift from the town for helping
	- preserved food worth 10 days ration
	- 5 gp worth of copper and silver
- start to turn in for the night
	- Norwick goes to patrol the town one last time
	- Comes across Torisen attempting to fix the Shrine of Luck to give offerings to the fae
	- Offers to help clean it up by fixing some of the heavier portions

- Now the 9th of Leaffall, 1512!
	- The sky is dark, but the stars are out :)

- Meet in the Manor to find a dark room, we all hold hands and Cosmo does some magic stuff with a watch he said can transport us very quick
	- wind starts to blow as we rise from the ground and start to spin
	- flashes and bangs and we are sent sprawling out on the ground
	- now in the bottom of a deep canyon, the sky is bright, and looks yellow as sand and debris blow overhead
- Cosmo sends his pigmy owl familiar, Pablo, to try and fly up to gauge where we are. He is unsuccessful.
- One way of the canyon collapses leaving only one way to move forward
- walk for about half an hour before coming across a pile of mixed mud, bones, and blood.
- Norwick tries to skirt around it after it seemingly does nothing, but Torisen grabs and pulls on the bone. It begins to move and shift forming 4 mud zombies.
- The party battles the mud zombies back, but Norwick briefly looses control. There's a failed attempt by Selakiir to grapple him with Vaecrix, but luckily Brighton charms him just long enough to get him to calm down.

- After some more analysis of where we are, and the realization that here has no North, we concluded that we had ended up in the elemental place of earth.
- Pallabar continued down the canyon, and the rest followed. Eventually coming to a sharp turn and a dead end. Pallabar reached out and touched the wall. Hir eye's began to glow silver and the ground began to shake. Ze turned to Norwick and smiled before the ground collapsed swallowing the party. Tumbling around in the dark before being plopped just outside of Settlestone, where we initially intended to go.

- Norwick asked Pallabar what ze had done to be able to do that, and why hir eyes turned silver, but ze seemed confused saying they just followed the same magic they saw when we teleported there. No one else saw anything similar.
