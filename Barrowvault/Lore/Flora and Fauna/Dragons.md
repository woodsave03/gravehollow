After the [[Destruction of Draconia]], the Dragons fled from the cities where they were held in a place of high honor, and established their hoards in demi-planes of their own creation. After the dread, with the veil between planes being weakened rumors float about of travelers accidently stumbling into a rift in the planes and stumbling into a dragons hoard. Of course these rumors can not be confirmed since no one has yet to find a dragon's hoard and lived to tell the tale.
