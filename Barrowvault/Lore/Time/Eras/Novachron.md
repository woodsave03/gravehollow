>[!info] Era Description
>The gods created nature and microorganisms came to be. The planes from which they tapped into for such creation (the elemental planes) began to leak in, wanting to take over the gods' creation and swallow it in chaos. some gods take the side of primordial and some don't, so the Trickster steals a spell from The Weaver that will siphon willing god's power to force all gods (including betrayer gods) into an super-exclusive slumber party within their world, guaranteeing its safety
