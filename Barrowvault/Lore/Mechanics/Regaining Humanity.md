>[!check]+ Regaining Humanity
>### Level 1: Land of the Living
>**Transformation Boons**: 
>Your time in death has given you resistance to poison and cold damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition. Maintaining a connection to the afterlife, undead creatures do not perceive you as hostile. Your body no longer requires sleep during a long rest, only needing an 8 hour period of light activity in order to recuperate.
>
>Your ghastly visage gives you advantage on any Charisma(Intimidation) checks against creatures that are not undead. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead.
>
>**Transformation Impairment**: 
>Being so new to the land of the living, you can maintain nothing more but a loose grip on life. Your sickly pale skin, and emaciated body is off-putting to any that see you, there is something clearly unnatural with your form. You have disadvantage on any Charisma(Persuasion) checks with any creatures that are not undead. Your memory of life before death is fuzzy and vague, you have disadvantage on any Intelligence(History) checks regarding your previous life.
>
>You ride the line between life and death and have disadvantage on death saving throws, and are considered undead when considering any spells or effects that affect undead creatures. Being undead, you share some of their weaknesses. Whenever you are dealt radiant damage, you must succeed a DC20 Constitution Saving Throw, or take double damage. Your body never truly dies but becomes a "Drowned Blade". Your soul is trapped within your mortal form, conscious and aware, but unable to control your actions.
> 
> ### Level 2: Death Defiant
> **Transformation Boons**: 
> You still reserve some powers from death giving you resistance to poison damage. Your body only requires 8 hours of light activity to gain the benefits of a long rest. If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point. You still look incredibly sickly and have advantage on Charisma(Intimidation) checks against creatures that are not undead.
> 
> **Transformation Impairments**: 
> Your skin starts to gain some color, and your body gains some weight. But you still look incredibly sickly to most people you encounter, a trained eye can still recognize there is something unnatural about your life. You are still considered undead when any spells or effects that affect undead are active. Details of your past life are still murky and hazy giving you disadvantage on Intelligence(history) checks regarding your previous life. When taking radiant damage make a DC15 Constitution Saving throw or take double damage. Your body never truly dies but becomes a "Drowned Assassin". Your soul is trapped within your mortal form, conscious and aware, but unable to control your actions.
> 
> ### Level 3: Humane Again
> **Transformation Boons**: 
> Your body still maintains a resistance to poison damage, from your time in death. If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point. Your frame is no longer sickly thin, and most of the color has returned to your skin. You no longer appear as if you have come back from death.
> 
> **Transformation Impairments**:
> You still share some weaknesses of undead and must succeed a DC10 Constitution Saving throw or take double damage, when dealt radiant damage. You are still considered undead for the purpose of any spells or effects that affect undead. Your body never truly dies but becomes a "Drowned Master". Your soul is trapped within your mortal form, conscious and aware, but unable to control your actions.
> 
> ### Level 4: More Than Mortal
> **Transformation Boons**:
> You are no longer just living, you have a solid grasp on life, and have become more than a mere mortal. You have kept a resistance to poison damage from your time of death. Your hold on life is so strong you have gained an advantage on death saving throws. If you roll a natural 20 on a death saving throw, your hit points increase to 1, and gain temporary HP equal to half your hit point total. You are able to sense any undead within 50 feet of you, and you understand their weak points and deal an extra 2d12 damage when attacking them.
> 
> You have become in tune with your past life and have advantage on ant Intelligence(History) checks regarding your past life. You age at half the pace that is normal for your race, and when the time comes that you should die, both your body and soul are able to pass away normally and find peace.
