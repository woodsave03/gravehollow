A magical metal found in the depths of the [[Loierr Fenest]], originating from a fragment of Umbrea's largest moon that crashed eons ago. It glows dimly with pale green light, proving life and magic to all that's around it, helping sustain underwater cities throughout the gulf.

The metal can also be harvested from the sea floor and purified, creating a silver metal that emits a bright white aura. This form is much more potent in it's arcane abilities and can be used to create very powerful magical items and defenses. The ancient draconic isles once learned how to use and harness its abilities, today [[Hellhaven]] has begun dredging the metal and purifying it to defend from arcane forces.

Although the largest and most plentiful deposit can be found at the bottom of the [[Loierr Fenest]] smaller deposits can be found all across Umbria where smaller chunks of debris have broken off and fallen to the ground.
