Hello son,

Despite the unfortunate news you bring, it is always a blessing to hear from you. We have gotten word of what happened at the inn nearby, and are glad that you were not among those harmed. 

You don't need to apologize to us, Norwick. I'm afraid we are the ones who have failed you. We should have told you about your grandparents. We hoped your grandfather's illness wouldn't affect you just as it seemed to have not affected your mother.

We are proud of you for taking it upon yourself to support those whose ambitions are well-meaning. You have always known how to find your place in a cause you believe in.

We appreciate the gold dragons as support, but you needn't worry about our financial state. We assure you we will be safe here in Neverwinter while you are off adventuring. All we ask that you send back to us are continued letters describing your stories on the road and how you are doing.

And whatever you do, do NOT go to Luskan. Only trouble awaits you there.

Love,
Mamachka and Papachka
