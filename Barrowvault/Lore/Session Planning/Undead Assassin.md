Big necromancer family

dead family and close friends that have been tormented by the necromancers
they have grudge

the family owns an ancient text with an extensive knowledge of the undead, how to lay them to rest, how to use their souls for power (soul magic moment?)

they have a huge house (it was grandma's but we can work with that)

husband, wife, ambitious child, and undead son (absolute brute)

book is connected to a society that had a project to develop the perfect assassin.

maybe the family is connected to the human wizard tower, an already dark branch of their society that snuck aboard

the book could be connected to an ancient undead god that travels from sphere to sphere

purple gems to bring undead back to corporality
ghosts could have a concentration mechanic to interact with physical objects
in the manor they are always visible unless a class feature is used to counteract that

chapter 19 is an appendix of frequently asked questions and tips with six items, last being a drawing with hidden text regarding a conversation about the question if an assassin's actions could be considered moral if they had not had personal cause to kill their targets (they killed his daughter), with  newer notes that say "Au contrair, there is talk of a newly developed assassin," with a purple gem underneath the leather hooded armor in the drawing.

Gem is located somewhere in the house, and is what's powering the son's physicality

the troublesome family's spirits have been captured and brought to the manor, and the necromancers are holding a large ritual to "put them to rest" along with a dead beloved one who isn't a problem for them but if they're gonna siphon soul power from most of the family why not go all out.

the husband asked me for coding help in an 8-bit compiler (yes it was actually displayed in 8-bit and read alternating lines in big endian and little endian)

there are special kinds of spirits that attach specifically to another spirit, and are fully committed to their safety as they were in life. these spirits are capable of continuously aware of the time that passes by while they are dead, they do not become stuck in death loops or memory scenes. these souls contain energy well-desired by soul siphons, but they are the most dangerous. as long as they are concentrating, they can retain most of their abilities. some more powerful abilities or abilities that physically interact with the world around them may require skill checks or saving throws by the soul, but they are still capable of fighting back against a family of necromancers and solving the puzzle as to when and how they should strike first.
