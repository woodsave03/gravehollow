<h1>The Dreaded Collide</h1>
<p>Two spheres collide in the realmspace starscape, merging and creating a new existence, a new reality. A cataclysm on an astral scale whose consequences are unfelt by the consciousnesses that reside within the storm's eye. Those who exist outside of the convergence are the only beings who can witness the grandeur of its impact.</p>
<h2>A Fractured Spirit</h2>
<p>When Umbrea and the Forgotten Realms were pulled together by an interdimensional rift in the Blue Veil, the planes' individual connections to the Outer Realms were disjointed temporarily. Any spirits unattached from the Material Plane whose journeys to the Fugue Plane were incomplete, they were ejected from the merging spheres, shunted and shattered, scattered to the cosmos and untethered from physical form.</p>
<p>Some souls found an anchor in physical vessels, some drift through the stars infinitely, some cross into the Far Realm and become something more, something other. And some, return home, only to find it drastically altered from their known reality.</p>
