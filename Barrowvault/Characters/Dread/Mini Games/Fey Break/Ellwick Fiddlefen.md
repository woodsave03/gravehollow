>[!info]+ Backstory
> $\quad$Ellwick has been living in Alaron for several decades, going by the alias of Eli Fenson. He remains hard at work in his own workshop, producing technology from his home to be shipped to Mirabar and sequentially sold to Neverwinter. He has been the sole supplier of the Neverwinter Rifle Corps, as the only craftsman familiar with the trade of gunsmithing and black powder. He keeps the chemical formulas and blueprints of his craft secret, as he knows the dire consequences of such knowledge becoming uncontrolled.

>[!important] Physical Description
> $\quad$Ellwick has soft, boyish features, not particularly thin, nor plump, nor muscular. No prominence of chin, nose, or cheekbones to be heard of. He has his own way of standing out from others, besides the matter of his pointed ears. A shock of red hair that gleams in the light of his clockwork torchbugs is kept to a short trim, to keep it from hindering his craft, an unkempt and unruly mess that stands up in every which way. Freckles spread across his small, round nose and cheeks.
> $\quad$After a freak accident, Ellwick's eyes are now off-putting shining turquoise crystals, no pupils or irises to be seen, simply continuous color. One of these lights starts to flicker, and his head cocks to the side, meeting with his hand as nimble fingers adjust the rotation and tap its surface, returning its glimmer in moments. These dexterous hands however are covered in wiring, almost creating a metallic exoskeleton, lining over where tendons stretch and piercing into the joints with various needles and straps. 
> $\quad$When he speaks it sounds raspy, and coiled strings vibrate around their neck, held just off the skin in concentric circles fit onto metal bars piercing through his neck and into his skull. When he speaks the vibrations are preceded by electric blue sparks traveling along the strings, spiraling around his neck and humming in reverb.
> $\quad$He’s wearing a dark leather trench coat, the sleeves rolled up revealing a layer of a sun-faded tunic sleeves and his forearms where what looks to be a symbol is branded into his small, pale wrist. The coat drapes down to the ground as he’s crouched down, a small notebook laid across his knees as he carefully pens something with fluid quill-strokes. He looks up at your arrival, quickly rising to his feet, but his originally small stature remains so at 3'4" as he reaches full height. The trench coat now reaches his lower thigh, resting over grey trousers, tucked inside leather boots, which reach to his upper calf. The collar of his coat reaches up towards his chin, a leather pauldron sitting next to it on his right shoulder, studded with iron reinforcement, held in place by a leather strap which crosses over his toughened leather breastplate and hooks onto his belt. Another leather strap attached to the right side of his belt crosses over to fasten the left side of his coat, where a brass timepiece is harnessed. He closes his notebook and slides it into a hidden pocket on the inside of his coat, placing his quill in one of the two small pouches latched onto the front his belt, and you can see what seems to be two coin purses as well, tied to belt loops on either side of his hips. He loops his thumb through the left strap of his backpack, adjusting his goggles, which has both a crystal lens and a metal covering with many bored holes. Immediately afterwards he smiles and waves at you, the three glowing, mechanical torchbugs casting a shadow of his hand over you.
