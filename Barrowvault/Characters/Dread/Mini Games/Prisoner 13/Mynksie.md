>[!info]+ Backstory
> $\quad$There is a reason to this jester's mystery, as they do not have a known origin. they do not come from a king's court, nor have they performed in circus of a lord's company. They have not learned juggling from traveling with minstrels or picked up their inspiration from roaming bards-for-hire. Behind their singular smile lies a tale untold, and that will remain so, as unchanging as the frozen expression they wear in the icy tundra they roam.
> $\quad$Mynksie, as people have come to know them, is, truly, a wind spirit. they flaunt their magics as entertainment, and live for the emotions they can bring to the children in their audience. The one who was Mynskie is long gone, but their presence remains in Icewind Dale, for they were boisterous and bull-headed in their past life, challenging a visiting minstrel to a duel of wonder and awe. What they did not know, was that this minstrel was a visiting faerie, and their deal was binding.
> $\quad$They put their fame on the line, their pride and their name. Were either party to win, they would win these treasures from the other, and may their charm decide the better.
> $\quad$They lost the game, and with it their name, and everyone forgot the Ten Towns' Tumbler. Their performances became that of yore, now tied to the fey's fame. their pact came into fruition through a binding to Mynksie's craft, they had unfinished business, to spread cheer and emotion across the north, but could never tell the story of the nameless bard.
> $\quad$Now this was long ago, and since their fall from fame, they have begun to make a name for themself once more. Centuries of commitment to their art has consumed them, changed them, into a shadow of what they once were. A wind spirit, an agent of tumultuous reaction, the tempest in the heart of all things, whose calling is to bring forth the emotions hidden away in people, tearing down walls and leaving souls windswept and raw, and therefore truest as could be.
> $\quad$They do not show their visage for they no longer have one. They are a pure force of presence, the one who was the Ten Towns' Tumbler, the nameless bard, is no more. Not dead, per se, but transformed, and forgotten. What is left behind is a performer even more mystical, moving like the wind and vaulting across the stage as if the very air carried them along, embodying the winds of time as they sang stories familiar and odd. Word of mouth is their trade, and acrobatics their medium. Just be wary of their wrath, for their sword is as swift as their tongue.

>[!important] Physical Description
> $\quad$Covered in court motley, patchwork in rich forest greens and cinnamon reds, and a billowing cloak of midnight blue. Silver bells adorning the corners and cuffs of fabric, jingling with each turn of the wrist, patter of the foot, flick of the cape and toss of the head, atop of which lies a three-pointed fool's hat, sitting just above the porcelain white static face of a grinning jester.
> $\quad$Covered from head to toe in festive garb, clashing patterns and bold embroidery, one cannot see an inch of skin, gloves covered in silver stars hide their hands and purple ombre hood of their cloak conceals their neck while it rests on their shoulders.
