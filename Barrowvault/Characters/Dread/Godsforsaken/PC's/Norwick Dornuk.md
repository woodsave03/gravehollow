>[!info]+ Backstory
>#### Early Life
>Norwick’s grandparents were originally from the spine of the world. After the dread they were forced to seek refuge in Luskan. When his parents were children aberration invasions forced them to escape further south to Neverwinter where it was a much nicer and safer place to live. As a child their parents would take them up along the Neverwinter River, sparking this interest within him to go out and explore outside the city. Much of their time as a kid was spent researching the Sword’s coast and other far away lands, and all the various things they would have to know in order to go out and explore beyond.

>#### Time in Rifle Corps
> Norwick joined the Neverwinter Rifle Corps almost as soon as they were able, craving  adventure and a chance to get out of the protected walls of the city of Neverwinter and explore the lands beyond. Norwick took his job seriously, as it provided him a chance to get outside the city and took great care in learning to properly use and care for his weapon. Norwick however, is aware of the scarcity and rarity of ammunition outside of the supply of the rifle corps, so he chose to also train in martial and simple weapons. Always keeping its great ax, a javelin, and two hand axes with it along with the standard issue musket, in order to be prepared for any situation. 
> 
> During a hunting excursion in the Neverwinter woods, searching for any demons or undead. While in the woods Norwick lost his temper in the midst of a small encounter, triggering the first appearance of his much more violent alter ego. Norwick lost control of his own mind and body, he not only defeated the monster they were facing, but almost their entire party was massacred. 
> 
> The only other survivor of his party found Norwick lying in the brush, dazed and his uniform in tatters. Norwick himself had retained very little memory of the actions they performed while in their rage. This continues to happen to Norwick anytime he is sent on an excursion into the woods. As these attacks have become more common, word has spread throughout the rifle corps about a monster in the woods that they are deemed incapable of stopping, and the city has hired mercenaries to try and defeat it.

> #### Current Time
> Norwick has continued to think and look back at his recent times spent in the Neverwinter Woods, and how he always seems to survive these freak encounters with no memory as to what happened. Looking and thinking back into these lost moments in time, in combination with more frequently occurring (though less aggressive) moments of anger where they can almost feel themselves growing stronger, body growing, vision going blurry; until he takes a deep breath and calms his emotions, and his its body returns to a normal state. Sometimes losing track of time only to wake up finding his own living quarters in shambles. The possibility has begun to grow in Norwick's mind that it was his fault that his hunting parties continue to never return home, not some beast that roams throughout the Neverwinter Woods.  Ever since this revelation Norwick has mainly tried to keep his head down, avoiding any extra attention, or questions as to what he knows about that hunt in the woods. Even separating himself from his monstrous side, and not feeling a connection with those actions. Any spare time he has outside of his rifle corps duties is mainly spent researching what could be the cause of his outbursts.

>[!important] Physical Description
>#### Normal 
>Tall 7'10" bugbear, standing very straight and at attention, towering over almost everyone around him. Their golden brown eyes almost always scanning the area for danger or a potential threat. Their eyes darting back and forth, nose sniffing for any scents that are out of the ordinary. Ears twitching at the smallest of noises. He has a thick protective bright orange undershirt, with a black over shirt pulled overtop. It seems to be very tightly fit on his very large frame. He has a fur shawl draped over his back and across their shoulders. An orange cloth belt is tied around his waste, with black pants that fit much looser around his long legs. The bottoms being held into place by wraps instead of boots like the rest of the Rifle Corps, these wraps are also tightly wound around his feet providing some more protection. The balmoral bonnet worn by most Rifle Corps members its pulled tightly over the top of his head, pushing his ears down. It wears leather arm guards, along with leather straps across his chest keeping his javelin, musket and his great axe tightly strapped to his back. Two hand axes are tied to his belt where he can easily access in case of emergency.

>#### Rage
>When in a rage they grow to about 8 feet tall, muscles rippling as they hunch over. His limbs growing to odd disproportionate lengths, causing him to lumber around. As his body and muscles grow, it begins to tear apart the shirt of his uniform leaving it in tatters. The wraps around his legs begin to pull apart exposing more of the fur underneath. The fur on his body becomes incredibly patchy as slimy sinewy muscles becomes exposed as he grows. His golden brown eyes narrow filling with rage, losing any kind of recognition when you look into their eyes. Its fangs growing large and jutting out of his mouth.
