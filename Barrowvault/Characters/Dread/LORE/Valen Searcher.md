>[!help]+ Info
> - Fled the destruction of [[Draconia]], with his Lady Wife Nonna Rossa, and some two thousand soldiers merchants and servants, mere days before a shift in the tapestry caused an end to the flying cities. He established a kingdom on another continent.
> (kingdom built on operatio[](Draconia.md)history says the locals bent the knee and swore fealty with open hearts)
> To this day, his kingdom still stands, the royal family still lords over the land, and his court is filled with draconian races and bird folk decent from the original party to cross the sea. The small folk are primarily made up of awakened beings. (except for bird folk, because they remind him of his wife who dies escaping :(, they get to chill with the nobles )
