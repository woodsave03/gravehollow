>[!info]+ Backstory
>Decorated naval officer of the Cormyrian Empire's fleet. This was 200 years ago. Corporal Velmontaghe, lost at sea during the Year of Blue Fire, when the skies were sundered by storm and the Great Rain began. My vessel capsized, but there was too much to be attended to by the royal court for any name to be added to the list of the deceased. 
>
>Now I am Sveng. I broke surface, escaping dark waters, to be met with an even darker sky. Everyone says the sun hasn't been out on a regular basis in centuries. I clung to buoyant wreckage until I encountered a ship in a storm. I clambered aboard, quickly hiding my figure under a coat I stole from a crewmember, then promptly pushed overboard. I cut my hair and wore a bandana to pass as masculine, afraid that the crew would cast me off out of superstitious belief.
>
>These were pirates. I spent my past life hunting these bastards, and I did some things I still regret. I soon began rumors that there was a woman aboard, and sure enough word spread quickly, leading to suspicion among the ranks. I planted my undergarments in the captain's quarters when the others were busy throwing dice and navigating, and I began to bind with whatever cloth and bandages I could keep clean.
>
>The pirates soon came to a point of intervention, and Captain Bulwrath was summoned to settle the dispute. Everyone soon came to the conclusion that none of them were the culprit, and so I piped up to challenge the captain's word. The others searched his quarters while we faced down, him enraged that I had the gall to challenge his word. He attacked and I defended myself, though he was skilled with a sabre. Not too long after the ring steel filled the deck, my short sword clattered to the side, leaving me only with a dagger.
>
>At this point crewmates returned with my undergarments, having found them buried in dresser drawers that I was sure Bulwrath never even used. While he was distracted, I charged, grabbing him by the torso over the shoulder and his wrist in my right hand, twisting it and his sabre as I slammed him to the deck. I slipped his pistol out of its holster as I stood over him, his hands sprawled out to either side of his head, mouth agape in shock. The men standing beside me deemed his dishonesty to his crew strips him of his title, and I leveled the pistol towards his head. After a pregnant pause, I fired, to the left of his cheek, barely grazing his earlobe and the earrings he wore. I leaned over and took his hat from his head and placed it on my own, assuming command immediately to veer us to the nearest friendly port.
>
>Of course, friendly to them meant something different to me, so I was met with an entire port town filled with miscreants of every flavor and ilk. I abandoned my crew, taking my belongings with me. I tried asking around at a tavern for passage to Cormyr, but they wouldn't talk until I bought a drink, and even then they weren't helpful. I drowned by troubles that night and eventually got kicked out for reasons that are too murky to recall.
>
>Cast out on the streets, I traveled through streets by torchlight and staggered through alleyways. In one such alley I was met by a few suspicious-looking characters that blocked my way. Turning around I found two others walking my way. I was too intoxicated to defend myself, and the next day I woke up with the worst headache I've ever had, my gun, sabre, and boots missing, and only the gods know what why the rest of my clothes were in a state of undress, though I highly doubt it was anything pleasant.
>
>I, Sulifyn Velmontaghe, have learned from those under the Code of the Fallen and have found honor within the system. I still hope to return to Cormyr to learn what came of the kingdom after the storms, and how I have returned.

#### Regaining Humanity

Level 1: Land of the Living

Transformation Boons: 
Your time in death has given you resistance to poison and cold damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition. Maintaining a connection to the undead, you can telepathically communicate to any undead within 50 feet of you. Your body no longer requires sleep during a long rest, only needing an 8 hour period of light activity in order to recuperate.

Your ghastly visage gives you advantage on any Charisma(Intimidation) checks against creatures that are not un-dead. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Transformation Impairment: 
Being so new to the land of the living, you can maintain nothing more but a loose grip on life. Your sickly pale skin, and emaciated body is offsetting to any that see you, there is something clearly unnatural with your form. You have disadvantage on any Charisma(Persuasion) checks with any creatures that are not un-dead. Your memory of life before death is fuzzy and vague, you have disadvantage on any Intelligence(History) checks regarding your previous life.

You ride the line between life and death and have disadvantage on death saving throws, and are considered undead when considering any spells or effects that affect undead creatures. Being undead, you share some of their weaknesses. Whenever you are dealt radiant damage, you must succeed a DC20 Constitution Saving Throw, or take double damage. Your body never truly dies but becomes a "Drowned Blade". Your soul is trapped within your mortal form, conscious and aware, but unable to control your actions.


Level 2: Death Defiant

Transformation Boons: 
You still reserve some powers from death giving you resistance to poison damage. Your body only requires 8 hours of light activity to gain the benefits of a long rest. If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point. You still look incredibly sickly and have advantage on Charisma(Intimidation) checks against creatures that are not un-dead.

Transformation Impairments: 
Your skin starts to gain some color, and your body gains some weight. But you still look incredibly sickly to most people you encounter, a trained eye can still recognize there is something unnatural about your life. You are still considered undead when any spells or effects that affect undead are active. Details of your past life are still murky and hazy giving you disadvantage on Intelligence(history) checks regarding your previous life. When taking radiant damage make a DC15 Constitution Saving throw or take double damage. Your body never truly dies but becomes a "Drowned Assassin". Your soul is trapped within your mortal form, conscious and aware, but unable to control your actions.


Level 3: Humane Again

Transformation Boons: 
Your body still maintains a resistance to poison damage, from your time in death. If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point. Your frame is no longer sickly thin, and most of the color has returned to your skin. You no longer appear as if you have come back from death.

Transformation Impairments: 
You still share some weaknesses of undead and must succeed a DC10 Constitution Saving throw or take double damage, when dealt radiant damage. You are still considered undead for the purpose of any spells or effects that affect undead. Your body never truly dies but becomes a "Drowned Master". Your soul is trapped within your mortal form, conscious and aware, but unable to control your actions.


Level 4: More Than Mortal

Transformation Boons: 
You are no longer just living, you have a solid grasp on life, and have become more than a mere mortal. You have kept a resistance to poison damage from your time of death. Your hold on life is so strong you have gained an advantage on death saving throws. If you roll a natural 20 on a death saving throw, your hit points increase to 1, and gain temporary HP equal to half your hit point total. You are able to sense any undead within 50 feet of you, and you understand their weak points and deal an extra 2d12 damage when attacking them.

You have become in tune with your past life and have advantage on ant Intelligence(History) checks regarding your past life. You age at half the pace that is normal for your race, and when the time comes that you should die, both your body and soul are able to pass away normally and find peace.
