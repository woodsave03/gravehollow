>[!info]+ Background
>Ely is a skilled trainer specializing in raising and caring for symbiotic animals and other magical beasts that live in harmony with Vrellyn’s residents. Her work includes training **Leafdrakes**, **Glimmer Moths**, and **Fungi-Beasts** used for companionship, labor, and security. Ely’s approach is straightforward and methodical, often missing social cues but always earnest and passionate about her work.

>[!important]+ Physical Description & Personality
>Ely is socially direct, often speaking bluntly and focusing on facts rather than social niceties. Her directness can be disarming but is always well-meaning. She has a deep empathy for the animals she trains and a keen understanding of their needs, often more comfortable in their presence than in large social gatherings.

>- Often seen carrying a small **Leafdrake** named Sylvie on her shoulder or a pouch with glowing moths.
>- Talks to her animals as though they are her closest friends, often sharing her thoughts and observations out loud.
>- Fascinated by the biology of symbiotic relationships, Ely might excitedly share detailed facts about the creatures, sometimes going into more detail than the listener expects or needs.

>[!caution] Interaction Hook
>Ely might approach the party with a request to help recover a rare symbiotic creature that has gone missing or to escort a group of newly trained beasts to a nearby settlement. Her direct manner may lead to humorous or awkward exchanges, but her expertise is invaluable in handling the unique creatures of Vrellyn.
