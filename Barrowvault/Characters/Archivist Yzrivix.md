>[!info]+ Background
>A primordial scholar of unknown origin who documented the survival of the exiled races in the Kagecombs. Their records, known as the **Tenebral Codices**, became the foundation of early subterranean law and society. Some speculate they were not mortal, as their writings contain knowledge beyond human lifespans.
