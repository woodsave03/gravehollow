>[!important] Appearance
>$\quad$Wind rolls over a hilly landscape, the brush whispers in a quivering dance. Thunderous roars rock the world like a storm as torrents of fire tumble out of jagged maws. The shrubs shift, staggering their movement across a scorched battlefield and break into a sprint as they reach a forest edge. Bush fronds fall from the muddied faces they covered, ropes binding the woody bundles and foliage to wrists now pumping in flight. Hand-spun clothes rustle underneath dried disguises but running steps fall silent, no matter the presence of the clamor of battle.
>$\qquad$A dark, curly-haired embroiderer works golden thread into a daughter's tunic. Glittering stalks of grain sprout from the neckline in a woven corona. Discrete threads trail underneath the fabric, their pattern and knots weaving a spell of luck between the threads. The embroiderer holds the finished garment up for rays of sunlight to pass through. Trails of lights spread over the threads, and wisp over the folds of the cloth, looping and spiraling over the left breast.
>$\qquad$Atop a cargo crate perches a bare-footed minstrel, one swinging in tempo as the crook of the other leg supports a drum with a pigskin stretched and pinned across the top. Minne Connyfer taps and flicks at her tantan with a song at her lips, amusement tugging at the corners of her mouth while she recites its bawdy lyrics. Her grin falters a moment as she scans the crowd upon the deck, her almond eyes falling upon a grey-hooded and thin figure lurking on the dock nearby with a sharp face and a piercing leer to match. Her hands trembled as the hooded figure boarded the ship, but her voice rang true and her song did not waver as they stepped slowly closer. They leaned in close enough for her to see the telltale scar across their throat of the silent [[Creosmagi]]. A white fishbone coin with the Spinster's eye engraved on either side flipped into the bowl set before her. She nodded at the figure as they gave her a squinting smirk before spinning away, robes trailing behind as they were swept away at a purposeful pace.

> [!info]+ History and Lore
> $\quad$The mulburrows live as a merry folk, though secluded from much of the other Umbrean societies. They began as a nomadic folk, during the era of war between dragons and giants, but have settled in a mountain valley held secret for generations. It is rare to find these folk outside of their green paradise, but it is well known that there is nearly always a mulburrow behind the greatest heroes and phenomena of yore.
