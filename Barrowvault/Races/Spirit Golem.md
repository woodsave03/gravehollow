>[!important]+ Appearance
>"Do I... frighten you?" The flickering lenses of an android mask fizzle with each spoken syllable from its perch upon a workbench strewn with bolts, scrap plates, and cogs. On a desk nearby is an even more severe mess of notebooks and sheets filled with runic scrawling in Giant script; character sequences approximating the equation of transferrable learning; a formula for an artificial conscience. Perspiring and hunched above their notes, an engineer taps a marker upon the work desk wood incessantly, before straightening up and inscribing a final rune, a self-satisfied grin tugging at their mouth as their eyes flit to the disembodied automaton as it awaits the response to its query.

>They trace the inner lining of the wig's scalp with an adhesive clay and firmly press it over their tattooed head. Scrutinizing their reflection in the mirror, they run a grey finger over their eyelids, leaving kohl shadow to contrast the russet irises scouring, emotionless, for unaccounted flaws. Picking up a thin-tipped brush from a stone vessel, they dip into flesh-colored paste and apply it over the slightest phantom of a scar apparent under layers of makeup. They needn't apply such detail to the rest of their appearance: donning a short-brimmed hat and a night jacket with trailing sleeves, they look back at the mirror as they slip on their velvet gloves. A ghostly visage dressed for the opera gazes back, its hair wispy and suspended in the silver-backed reflection. Squeezing their eyes shut, they flush the image from their mind and touch the brim of their hat against the streetlamps as they pull the door shut.

>Deer's antlers protrude from an otherwise indistinguishable tangle of ivy and thorn reaching to wrap the base of a tree. The keen eye can discern a head hung low, rest against the wooden chest of an abandoned woad well past its days of animation. Creeping mist brings the spreading swamp closer to the edge of this woods, and brings its waters' infestation of spores along with it. Seeping into the roots of the great tree, a network of fungal growths enter the husk and fill it with the sounds of life. A system of organic contraptions pump energy from its once rotting cavities to its primary limbs. The soft glow of bioluminescence fills the deer head's sockets, introducing new purpose to this discarded form. Thousands of discorporate voices hiss in unison a common objective: "Grow farther, and spread our unity. Let peace be discovered in symbiosis."

> [!info]+ History and Lore
> Natural golems have been animated and sculpted by the druids of Umbrea for centuries, and many have tried to perfect the art. A certain pursuit of intelligence has led some of these golems to present a level of consciousness. This has been achieved in several different ways: perhaps a stray forest spirit was infused within the golem's form, maybe an ancient warden has been magically altered and improved over decades to result in a moment of "birth of awareness" in more recent years, or the biological nature of the golem's materials resulted in a collective consciousness between its myriad parts and components.
> 
> Spirit golems can come in all kinds of materials and origins. Most commonly, they are made in the image of leshen, the wardens of the wood and the Glistening Canopy. However some are animated nonliving material such as soil or stone, or even flesh, mimicking the more typical image of a golem brought to Umbrea by the humans of the Ark. More rarely, a spirit golem could be a feat of technology, perhaps even a mixture of spirit magics and cogwork from the gnomish city of [[Vergrenzig]].

> These construct-spirit hybrids are distinguished by their fresh perspective of the world, and their history of servitude. As the children of golems, these autonomous creatures are viewed as lesser servants who have little to no emotional capabilities. Any golems who act outside of a humanoid's orders are viewed as "rebellious" and "dangerous" and an "insult to the arcane".
