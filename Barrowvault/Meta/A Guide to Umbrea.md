## General Information

Welcome to Umbrea, a continent of eldritch wonder, fey trickery, and ancient conflicts. Umbrea is a land shaped by the interplay of natural magic, lurking horrors, and civilizations clinging to survival amidst the unpredictable forces around them. 

The continent is defined by: 
#### Fey and Shadow Influence: 

Umbrea is deeply intertwined with the feywild and shadowfell, with pockets of reality bending to their whimsical and often dangerous will. 
#### Eldritch Threats: 

Corruption, rot, and mysterious entities constantly test the resolve of its inhabitants. 
#### Cultural Diversity: 

Populated by anthropomorphic animal folk, genasi, dwarves, orcs, fey, goblins, gnomes, fantasy races, and humans, alongside rarer races tied to Umbrea’s mystical and wild nature. 
#### Environmental Extremes:

Dense forests to the south, deserts and dead seas to the north, vast fungal swamps to the south, wild ocean to the west, a river canyon down the center, and untamed mountain ranges to the east dominate the landscape. Each region has unique resources, dangers, and magical phenomena. 
#### Fragile Alliances: 

Travel between cities and settlements is dangerous due to the shadowfell and fey influences on the land and eldritch horrors, but trade, mutual defense, and politics weave complex relationships across Umbrea.
