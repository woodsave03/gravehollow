### The desert surrounding the dark sun, is it a cold desert, or is it hot?

<p>It is cold and dry, the night is the most dangerous temperature-wise, which just happens to be the constant state of the sky. </p>

### Are mortals aware that there are sub-gods under the main ideas they name and worship?

$\quad$\*finger wag*

### where did the human tower come from, why did they come here?

%%TODO%%

### do different races worship different pantheons, or same gods?

<p>
The same "domains." From the DM perspective, the domains are a bunch of gods, including different race's interpretations of certain domains. Though the mainstream religions will often refer to a single pantheon with domains such as the <a href="obsidian://open?vault=Umbrea&file=Pantheon%2FGods%2FThe%20Big%20Spider">Weaver</a>, those domains can be made up of many different gods. When some cultures have different representations of those domains, a new divine spark brings light to another god to maintain that domain.

Essentially they are a bunch of departments with different representatives.

### Where/when/why do elves come to Umbrea?  ^e2217c

==When==: Elves came before many of the humanoid races evolved, before the [[Elementals]] invaded from the [[Prime Elemental Planes]]. During their visit, the gods were dormant, and only the spirits of the land were present. These proved to be both welcoming and dangers to the elves, as they interacted with both light and dark spirits. Instances of the elves' interactions with light spirits are memorialized through monuments left by the elves, often stone shaped with natural magics. Monuments resulting from interactions with the dark spirits often function as warnings, but some even ward dark spirits away. These arcane relics are made of [[Petrolune]] and are powered by a combination of the Elves' astral infusion with the spiritual magic learned from the light spirits. These [[Elvish Monuments]] still stand today, and serve as an eerie reminder of the existence of otherworlds that dot the night sky.

### What's up with the desert city? 

The [[Desert City]] is a gnomish underground outpost that specializes in automaton defense systems, mostly out of necessity, since the exit from the [[Underdark]] that they emerged from is located in the [[Northern Desert]]. These automatons serve as protection from any stray fiendish members of the [[Blood War]] that occurs near [[The Chasm]] and the [[Dark Sun]]. Ever since the [[Desert City]] established a trade route with [[Hellhaven]], it has benefited from selling both its expertise in automatons for keeping the law, as well as allowed young artisans to branch out to further magical tinkering contraptions that are considered desirable by the ports and businesses within the city. Such prosperity has even allowed some [[Desert City]] residents to travel to [[Hellhaven]]'s [[Great Library]] and research new engineering exploits. This is what led to the trolley system across the fjord between the two cities. 

> [!important]+
> The [[Great Library]] is also host to the current research project of an underground train system. There is opportunity for players to invest in this project, as well as assist on the ground on construction sites. Clearing out the [[Underdark]] takes more than a few engineers, don't ya know?

With the trolley system has come tourists from southern cities, who bring with them a thirst for entertainment. To address this, a particular artificer who considers themself a history buff, **INSERT NAME HERE**, has designed a fighting arena for traveling adventurers to test their mettle against an altered version of an ancient gladiator arena originating from the Age of the [[Draconia]]. This [[Gnomish Arena]] has implemented new dangers upon the battlefield, including space for caged beasts to be released upon participants, as well as trapped elements of the obstacles within the arena.

### How many moons are there?

!roll d12
### How do plants grow?

The dormant gods are using whatever divine reserves they have left to maintain the balance of nature, allowing plants to metastasize the light of the moons to grow at a stunted rate. Otherwise local druid circles will use what skills they have with channeling natural forces to promote healthy growth.
