### Overview

>[!important]+ Description
>
>Hellhaven is a sprawling city located at the eastern edge of [[Loierr Fenest]], where the fjord meets the [[Windbor Coast]]. Founded in 1933, it became the epicenter of human theocracy, built upon the arrival of both humans and their god. The city serves as both a seat of power and a beacon of divine influence, with towering temples and dark spires dominating the skyline. Hellhaven’s streets are a mix of industrialization, religious fervor, and societal control, reflecting both the power of The Lord and the struggles of those living under his rule. Despite its oppressive atmosphere, Hellhaven remains a thriving hub of political and religious activity, drawing citizens and refugees alike seeking to live under the strict doctrine of The Lord.
>
>Hellhaven’s history is one of divine governance, military dominance, and a slow shift from the natural to the imposed. Once, the land was fertile and lush, but now it bears the scars of overuse and divine exertion. The city's buildings rise tall, made from black stone and wrought iron, often shrouded in a perpetual haze from incense and the ever-present magic that permeates the air.

>### First Impressions
>#### Atmosphere
>
>**Dark and Heavy:** The air is thick with a sense of divine oppression and incense, carried by the constant hum of religious rituals. The scent of burning offerings lingers in every corner, and the oppressive weight of divine oversight hangs over the city like a perpetual storm cloud. 
>**Magic-infused:** The air feels heavy with divine magic, and the streets pulse with enchantments woven by the clergy to ensure the divine presence of The Lord is felt in every corner of the city. Despite this, there’s an undercurrent of fear, as the city’s inhabitants know that any signs of rebellion or dissent are swiftly dealt with.
>#### Populace
>
>**Devout and Subjugated:** The citizens of Hellhaven live under a strict theocracy, their lives governed by The Lord’s will. Religion and governance are inseparable, and almost every aspect of daily life is influenced by the city’s devout clergy. Despite this, there are murmurs of dissent among the more oppressed and disenfranchised groups, though open rebellion is rare due to the constant surveillance and control of the Inquisitors. 
>**Resilient but Fearful:** The people of Hellhaven have learned to live with fear and reverence, constantly watching their actions, thoughts, and words. The deep piety instilled by the church is a double-edged sword—while it provides a sense of purpose and unity, it also stifles any attempts at self-expression or deviation from the divine law. 
>**Class Divisions:** The city is deeply divided into classes, with the clergy and military occupying the highest echelons, while the common folk serve in subjugation to The Lord's divine will. The lower classes are relegated to menial tasks, working the factories and serving the wealthy, while the elite enjoy the privileges of power and influence.
>#### Rapport
>
>**Enforced Piety:** Hellhaven is renowned for its unwavering dedication to The Lord. Its citizens are constantly reminded of their place within the divine order, with the clergy acting as the primary enforcers of religious law. The Inquisitors, a military and religious police force, patrol the city, ensuring that no one deviates from the prescribed teachings and practices. 
>**Cultural Repression:** Hellhaven’s culture is one of strict obedience to The Lord’s will. Festivals and celebrations are rare, often occurring only during holy days or the anniversaries of significant religious events. Even then, they are imbued with solemnity and reverence, lacking the joy or exuberance found in other cities. Secretive underground movements occasionally attempt to overthrow the established order, but they are always stamped out swiftly by the ruling authorities. 
>**Power Struggles:** While outwardly Hellhaven appears unified under the rule of The Lord, there are political struggles between various factions of the clergy and military. These factions vie for influence and power, and while they may outwardly present a united front, there are deep fractures within the system that often lead to covert power struggles. 
>**Religious Sanctity:** Despite its oppressive nature, Hellhaven is a pilgrimage site for those seeking divine enlightenment or wishing to prove their devotion to The Lord. Pilgrims travel from across the land to pay homage to The Lord’s temples, seeking blessings or guidance, often unaware of the city’s darker underbelly.

> [!example]+ Residents
> 
> Hellhaven is a city of devout followers and those desperate enough to seek refuge within its walls. Its population is primarily composed of humans and celestial-descended beings, with a significant number of military personnel, clergy, and administrative officials. The Inquisitors hold the most power, serving as both enforcers of divine law and elite military agents. The lower classes often live in fear, working in the factories or serving the clergy in menial ways.
> 
> Many come to Hellhaven out of necessity—some by birth, others by the will of the Church, and some seeking salvation or answers from The Lord. However, dissent is brewing beneath the surface. Underground movements and secret alliances work to resist the city’s divine control, though they are largely unsuccessful due to the ever-watchful eye of the Inquisitors.
> 
> While Hellhaven is a city of faith, it is also a place of secrecy, danger, and political intrigue, where the line between devotion and manipulation is often blurred.

> [!info]+ History and Lore
> 
> The history of Hellhaven is closely tied to the arrival of humans in 1932, when they brought with them their god, The Lord. The city’s foundation was built on the establishment of a newfound gift of calming storms; Gellhafn. Over time, Gellhafn became theocratic in nature, with its power base shifting from a simple town to a sprawling city-state ruled by the clergy and military.
> 
> During the early years of the city’s formation, tensions arose between the political or mercantile elites and the Concordat of Chains, each seeking to claim authority of Gellhafn. These tensions came to a head during the Dread Era, when Gellhafn’s influence over surrounding regions grew, sparking conflicts with neighboring settlements and factions.
> 
> Despite these challenges, Gellhafn become Hellhaven, who survived and flourished, its population growing through both religious fervor and military conquest. The city’s infrastructure became more complex, with the creation of the Inquisitors as both a religious police force and a military arm of The Lord’s divine will. Today, Hellhaven stands as a symbol of divine rule and unwavering order, although beneath its holy exterior lies a web of political intrigue and hidden dissent.

### Prompt Summary

Hellhaven is a theocratic city-state built atop of ancient astral elven ruins, where a once-thriving free city of Gellhafn fell to the iron grasp of the theocratic leadership of the Concordat of Chains during The Dread. In 1932, subterranean settlers arrived after years in the caves of the Kagecombs below, reshaping the ruins into a center of naval and mercantile dominance after the fallout of the elemental storms of the Tenechron era. The Dread occurred in 2020, sending the arcane Fabric into chaos, where newly arriving humans stepped in and established a new order under the clergy of The Lord. Now, in 2114, Hellhaven is a rigid theocracy where the clergy wields absolute power, enforcing divine law through a brutal Inquisition. The upper city is dark but industrial with the remaining grandeur of Gellhafn's strong trade partners, however the lower districts are rife with dissent, magus' and thieves' guilds, black-market dealings, and whispers of rebellion. Beneath the surface, ancient secrets lurk in the ruins of the past, challenging the church’s divine narrative of a new order in the absence of the "old gods". Hellhaven stands as a beacon of control in a fractured world, its influence extending far beyond its walls—whether through faith, fear, or force.
