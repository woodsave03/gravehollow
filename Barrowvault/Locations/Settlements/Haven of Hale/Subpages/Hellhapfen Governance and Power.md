<h2>Settlement Leaders</h2>
Hellhaven is ruled through divine law, upheld by a structured theocratic hierarchy. Power is centralized within The [[Concordat of Chains]], a ruling body that dictates legislation, military actions, trade policies, and spiritual doctrine.

### **The Concordat of Chains**

A tribunal of **seven High Edicts**, each overseeing **different aspects of law and governance**.

#### **The Seven High Edicts** 

1. **High Edict of Binds** – Oversees **law enforcement, punishment, and judiciary matters**.
2. **High Edict of Tithes** – Ensures **tax collection, resource distribution, and trade oversight**.
3. **High Edict of Flame** – Manages **industry, infrastructure, and arcane energy harnessing**.
4. **High Edict of the Ledger** – Controls **historical record-keeping, bureaucracy, and census data**.
5. **High Edict of the Word** – Directs **religious doctrine, conversion efforts, and temple affairs**.
6. **High Edict of the Brine** – Regulates **naval defense, maritime trade, and sea-based industries**.
7. **High Edict of the Gate** – Handles **immigration, border security, and internal travel permissions**.

Despite the [[Creosmagi]]’s brutal efficiency, Hellhaven’s oppressed lower classes have fueled the rise of secret societies and insurgent groups:

- **The Hooded Covenant** – A hidden sect within the clergy itself, questioning the Lord’s divinity.
- **The Hollowed** – A group of former citizens stripped of their Creosmarks, surviving in the city’s ruins.
- **The Gilded Knives** – An elite guild of assassins and spies, operating under noble patronage.
