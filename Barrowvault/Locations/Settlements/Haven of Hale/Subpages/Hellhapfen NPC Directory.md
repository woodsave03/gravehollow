Verrik is a man of few words, and his reputation for decisive action has earned the company lucrative contracts.

Duskholt is known for using subtle manipulation and long-term planning to secure his position, often outmaneuvering rivals without ever showing his hand. His wealth allows him to influence every major political decision in the city, and his ability to broker favorable deals for Hellhaven ensures his place among the city’s most powerful individuals. Beneath his smooth exterior, however, Duskholt has a dark reputation for getting his hands dirty when needed, even if it means removing anyone who gets in his way.
- [[Ambassador Helia Varne]] *(b. 2089)* - Helia Varne serves as the official liaison between Hellhaven and its trading partners, most notably the [[Rellavoss|Republic of Rellavoss]]. She is a gifted diplomat, known for her ability to secure mutually beneficial agreements between the city's various factions and the powerful mercantile republic. Varne’s success is rooted in her ability to balance power, charm, and ruthlessness in every negotiation.

Though her primary role is that of a spy and infiltrator, Lyric is also skilled in deception, blackmail, and covert operations.

Many of Hellhaven’s elites unknowingly find themselves entrapped by Lyric, whose true loyalty lies not with the rich and powerful but with the Lanterns and their agenda.

## Historical Figures

>[!danger]- **Queen Nyssa of the Hollow Veil** _(r. 1600s - ?)_
>A dark elven ruler who forged alliances between the isolated settlements of the Kagecombs, establishing trade routes that would later become crucial for resettlement on the surface. She was famed for her use of **umbra-woven silk**, a rare textile infused with shadow magic. Legends claim she still rules in some hidden enclave beneath the world.

>[!danger]- **Hierophant-Magus Aulmareth** *(d. ~1920)*
>An enigmatic mage-priest who prophesied the end of the elemental storms decades before they ceased. Some believe he played a secret role in stabilizing the Fabric, though his followers insist he ascended before he could witness the world’s return to the surface. His abandoned sanctum, buried deep in the Kagecombs, is still sought by scholars and treasure hunters.

>[!danger]- **Prophet-Admiral Sefor Jurek** _(fl. 1930s)_
>Commander of the Ark Tower and human leader in Gellhafn
>Led the first human fleet to Gellhafn in 1932, integrating human settlers into the city's existing power structure. His followers introduced the worship of **The Lord**, which gradually gained traction among the city's ruling elite.

> [!danger]- **Felecia Everhart, The Last Matron** *(d. ~1940)* 
> Felecia Everhart was the final Matron of the Mist Shapers, a secretive sect of mages who were once revered for their ability to manipulate the strange energies left behind by the Elemental Storm. Everhart was accused of using forbidden rituals to control the flow of mist and was executed publicly in one of Hellhaven’s grandest displays of power. Her death marked the end of the Mist Shapers and the beginning of Hellhaven's stricter stance on magic. However, whispers of her power persist, and some believe her spirit still haunts the fog-covered regions of the city.

>[!danger]- **Commander Elara Vael** *(d. ~1950)*
>One of Hellhaven's earliest military commanders, Elara led the Stormbreaker Campaign against the monstrous forces that emerged after the elemental storm. Her actions helped establish Gellhafn as a fortified city, ensuring its survival during the early years of its formation. However, her death during a ritualistic event in the Mist Veil led to the eventual ascension of the current authoritarian regime. She is a controversial figure, with some viewing her as a martyr and others as a symbol of oppressive military rule.

> [!danger]- **Harven Norrick** *(fl. 1960s)*
> A former pirate captain who rose to prominence after the Mist Veil disaster, Harven Norrick was instrumental in organizing the [[Istrecce|The Free Enclaves of Istrecce]]. His initial involvement in Hellhaven's early mercantile agreements saw him broker several under-the-table deals with the clergy, providing essential supplies during the city’s rebuild. Norrick’s fortunes changed after a failed attempt to seize power during a factional civil war. His escape into the outer gulf marked the beginning of his infamous pirate career. Though labeled a traitor by the clergy, Norrick’s name is still whispered in the taverns of Hellhaven as a symbol of rebellion and freedom.

> [!danger]- **Caius Rhorn, The Merchant King** *(fl. 1960s-1980s)*
> Caius Rhorn was the wealthiest merchant in Hellhaven during the early days of its transformation into a thriving port city. He was the first to establish trade routes with the [[Vergrenzig]], facilitating the exchange of goods that would fuel Hellhaven's growth into a metropolis. Rhorn was a master of negotiation, often playing rival factions against each other to increase his influence. His assassination remains a mystery, but his fortune and the merchant guilds he founded continue to shape Hellhaven's economy to this day.

> [!danger]- **Empress Sylvara Morn** *(d. ~2000)*
> Empress Sylvara was a visionary who sought to create alliances with the nearby gulf nations during the days of Gellhafn’s most fragile state. Known for her diplomatic grace and foresight, she expanded the city’s trade routes and helped broker peace agreements with the [[Rellavoss|Republic of Rellavoss]] and [[Vethmar|Tidecourt of Vethmar]]. However, her reign was cut short when she mysteriously disappeared, leaving behind only cryptic messages about “a storm within.” While some believe she was a victim of a coup, others suggest she vanished voluntarily as part of a larger conspiracy involving powerful factions within the city.

> [!danger]- **Lord Athelius Corvenar** *(r. 2020s - 2030s)*

He led the establishment of the The Lord's Mandates after the city’s transformation into a theocracy, marking the beginning of the clergy’s dominance. Though largely remembered for his role in shaping the new religious laws, Athelius was also a shrewd political leader who consolidated power and unified the city’s factions under a single banner. Some claim he made a secret pact with arcane forces, although such rumors were never proven. His legacy remains deeply interwoven with the city's current structure.

>[!danger]- **The Phoenix Magister** *(fl. ~2030)*

She created much of the legal framework still in place today, particularly the codification of laws regarding magical regulation and retribution. Known for her unyielding sense of justice, she personally oversaw several high-profile trials, some of which led to public executions. Though revered by many, Malstrad's strict interpretation of The Lord’s Mandates sparked fear and loathing in others, especially those accused of arcane practices.
