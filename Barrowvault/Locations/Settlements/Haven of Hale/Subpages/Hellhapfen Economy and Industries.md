<h2>Invention</h2>
Hellhaven thrives on arcano-mechanical advancements, blending etheric technology, imported [[Vergrenzig]] engineering, and its own unique resources, such as [[petrolune]]—a volatile, semi-organic mineral that can store and release arcane power in controlled bursts.

#### **Creosmark Tokens – The Soulbound Permits**

One of Hellhaven’s most controversial and omnipresent inventions is the Creosmark Token, issued to all citizens. These tokens are:

- Forged from [[petrolune]], infused with a drop of the bearer’s blood, and soul-bound upon activation.
- Essential for movement, as [[Creosmagi]] (clergy enforcers) scan them to ensure individuals are where they belong.
- Personalized, containing a record of employment, permissions, and any legal infractions.
- Temporarily deactivated as punishment, preventing access to workplaces or barring movement beyond certain districts.
- Illegally forged or stolen tokens are worthless, as they are inert to anyone except their bound owner.

These tokens are administered and maintained by The Lord’s Tithe Commission, which enforces their distribution, renewal, and revocation.

#### **Petrolune Firelances – The "Lawgiver" Weapons**

- [[Petrolune]]'s explosive properties have been harnessed into firelances, carried by elite [[Creosmagi]].
- These weapons function as arcane muskets, launching controlled etheric bursts at criminals and dissenters.
- The higher-ranking enforcers wield Lawgiver variants, which have multiple firing modes, including:
    - **Judgment Shot** – A concussive blast to incapacitate.
    - **Retribution Arc** – A burning bolt of searing energy.
    - **Atonement Lance** – A restraining etheric tether.

#### **Petrolune-Powered Pneumatic Rails**

Due to the winding, steep, and uneven terrain of Hellhaven, traditional carts struggle to navigate the streets. Instead, the city has developed:

- Pneumatic rail carts that use controlled petrolune combustion to propel passenger lifts, cargo trams, and supply trolleys.
- These systems operate on sealed pressure channels, reducing the risk of uncontrolled explosions.
- Stations exist at various altitude points, allowing easier movement for workers and goods**.

### **Etheric Power Harnessing** 

Instead of petrolune, the city utilizes arcane energy similar to electricity, imported from Vergrenzig’s research. This fuels lamplights, lifts, and industrial machines.

#### **Self-Winding Automata**

Gnome- and dwarf-crafted mechanical constructs assist in shipbuilding, mining, and clerical duties.
#### **Sealock Mechanisms** 

Engineering advancements in docking technology allow ships to be elevated between sea levels using arcane hydraulics.
