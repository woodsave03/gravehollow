## Trade Partners

- **[[Rellavoss|Republic of Rellavoss]]** – A city-state with a powerful merchant council that controls much of the western gulf's trade. [[Rellavoss]] brokers deals between Hellhaven and less authoritarian polities.
- **[[Vergrenzig]]** – An industrial powerhouse renowned for its steampunk and arcane-powered engineering. Vergrenzig provides Hellhaven with advanced machinery, steamships, and arcane-powered infrastructure, such as its engineered lighting systems.
- **[[Ironwreath Syndicate]]** – A powerful cartel of industrialists operating out of the subterranean city of [[Khoz-Grimvar]] to the east. They export engineered arcane lighting systems, reinforced ship hulls, and steam-powered constructs to Hellhaven in exchange for processed Petrolune and rare alchemical reagents.
- **[[The Pale Market of Quenhal]]** – A vast trade network run by nomadic primordial merchants that controls the flow of exotic materials harvested from deep-sea trenches and the storm-touched tundras of the north. Their dealings with Hellhaven remain discreet, as they frequently sell goods considered illegal under the Concordat of Chains.
- **[[The Commonwealth of Aexithis]]** – A bureaucratic confederation of gnomish city-states specializing in ship automatons and arcane propulsion engines. Their relationship with Hellhaven is mutually beneficial, though fraught with tension due to their open acceptance of arcane magic.

## Allies

- **[[Tidecourt of Vethmar]]** – A submaritime kingdom ruled by a hereditary admiralty of sea elves, where noble houses are expected to contribute magically-enhanced ships that can dock underwater rather than land or wealth to maintain their status.
- **[[The Argent Bastion]]** – A militarized theocracy in the northern mountains that reveres The Lord as a divine enforcer of law. They frequently supply Hellhaven with battle-hardened knights and inquisitors to aid in maintaining the city's strict social order, tolling through a trial where they cross [[The Chasm]] to reach their ally to the south.
- **[[The Caedrith Accord]]** – A coalition of guilds and scholars who seek to regulate the lawful study of magic under strict theological doctrine. While they do not directly ban arcane practice like Hellhaven, they provide oversight and guidance, ensuring only sanctioned casters operate within allied territories.
- **[[The Sable Warden Conclave]]** – A reclusive order of judges and executioners who travel between Hellhaven and its allies to enforce justice under the Concordat’s decrees. Their presence ensures no heretic or fugitive escapes retribution.

## Enemies

- **[[The Umbral League]]** – A network of rogue mages, anarchists, and exiled scholars who work to undermine Hellhaven’s rule and free those persecuted for forbidden magic. They operate in secret across the region, sabotaging enforcement efforts wherever possible.
- **[[The Crimson Tide]]** – A notorious fleet of corsairs, privateers, and rogue merchants who directly oppose Hellhaven’s naval dominance. Their bases remain hidden within the labyrinthine inlets of [[Istrecce]], raiding trade routes and smuggling illicit goods.
- **[[The Veilborne Collective]]** – A heretical sect that worships a pantheon of ancient, forgotten deities in defiance of The Lord’s singular dominion. They infiltrate the city’s lower districts, spreading their doctrine in whispers and shadows.
- **[[The Ashen Court of Luthrenne]]** – An empire of necromancer-kings who reject the Concordat’s strict religious doctrine, instead ruling through legions of tireless undead servitors. Hellhaven considers their existence an abomination and has waged an undeclared war against them for decades.

## Neighbours

- **[[Istrecce|The Free Enclaves of Istrecce]]** – A loose confederation of island settlements and pirate holds that operate outside of official Gulf Concord law. They are frequently targeted by Hellhaven’s navy but continue to evade total suppression.
- **[[Velshyrn]]** – A windswept fortress-city built into the cliffs south of Hellhaven, home to an ancient order of storm-callers and navigators. While neutral, their expertise in controlling the treacherous fjord currents is invaluable to the region’s maritime powers.
- **[[Néthivrë, the Drowned Court]]** – An abandoned elven city half-submerged beneath the waves, now ruled by a cabal of deep-sea aberrations. Sailors whisper that its inhabitants were cursed for ancient crimes against The Lord, and Hellhaven forbids travel to its ruins.
- **[[The Ember Holds]]** – A chain of volcanic islands to the northwest, occupied by a mix of fire genasi, dwarven smith-clans, and warlike mercenary houses. While they trade raw metal and obsidian freely, their independence and refusal to kneel to the Concordat prevent closer ties.
- **[[Draeven’s Cradle]]** – A floating atoll-turned-city, where exiles, debtors, and displaced communities have forged a society free from the influence of greater powers. Hellhaven keeps a wary eye on them, suspecting that they harbor fugitives and dissidents.
