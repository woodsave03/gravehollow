<h2>Layout</h2>
<h3>Planning</h3>
Hellhaven is a meticulously **planned** city, structured around strict principles of order and efficiency dictated by **The Lord’s adjudicators**. Streets follow a rigid grid pattern, with major roads radiating outward from **The Vault of Penance**, ensuring that all paths symbolically lead back to the center of divine and legal authority. **Walls and barriers segment** the city into carefully controlled districts, each serving a distinct purpose. Watchtowers, checkpoints, and observation posts are positioned to monitor movement, ensuring that no illicit activity escapes the gaze of **The Lord’s enforcers**.
<h3>Districts</h3>
Hellhaven, also known in ancient records as **Gellhafn**, has grown into a sprawling **metropolis of industry, faith, and maritime power**. The city is a crucial **trade hub**, thanks to its strategic position at the mouth of a **fjord-lined gulf**, and its culture has absorbed **steampunk innovations from [[Vergrenzig]]**, blending them with **strict religious oversight**.
#### **The Adjudicary** _(Government & Religious Quarter)_

- Seat of **The Lord’s clergy**, including **The Vault of Penance** and **The Codexorium**, where divine law is dictated and transcribed. The city’s **ruling sect, The Concordat of the Lord**, enforces unwavering obedience.
#### **The Tribunal Forum** _(Commerce & Civil Affairs)_

- Bustling with trade halls, judicial squares, and **regulated** markets. **Arbiter’s Call**, a bureaucratic stronghold, ensures that all transactions remain under the watchful eyes of the clergy.
#### **Chainmoor Brine Yards** _(Docks & Industrial Shipping)_

- A vast **shipyard**, famed for producing **steam-powered vessels** using **[[Vergrenzig]]-imported innovations**. The district is dense with warehouses, repair docks, and smuggling rings hiding within the **labyrinthine canals**.
#### **The Ironclad Sprawl** _(Tinker’s & Artificer’s Quarter)_

- A newer district, filled with **mechanists, artificers, and alchemists**, many of whom are immigrants from [[Vergrenzig]]. Gas-lit signs flicker above shopfronts, advertising **arcane-electric engines**, clockwork contraptions, and mechanized limbs.
#### **The Aegis Bastions** _(Military Quarter)_

- A fortified garrison, where **The Judicars and the Inquisitorial Guard** maintain an **iron grip on security**. **The Lord’s Wardens** train here, and massive **airship docks** service military patrol vessels.
#### **Penitent’s Rise** _(Residential & Clerical Housing)_

- A dense **multi-tiered district** stacked along the city’s **steepest inclines**, where the city’s middle class and clerical administrators reside. **Golemic lifts**, powered by arcane electricity, ferry people between levels.
#### **The Chainstock Wards** _(Industrial Slums & Low-Class Housing)_

   - A **smog-choked**, overcrowded district where factory workers, dock laborers, and **debt-bound "Redemptives"** toil beneath the looming spires of the wealthier districts above.
#### **The Wraithmire Quarter** _(Shrouded & Haunted Ruins)_

   - The oldest part of the city, **a ghostly, mist-covered ruin** from the elemental storm’s fallout centuries ago. Few dare to live here, but some **black-market traders, fugitives, and heretics** hide in the mist-choked alleyways.
<h2>Thoroughfares</h2>
<h3>Modes of Travel</h3>
Due to **Hellhaven’s steep and winding streets**, traditional carts struggle to traverse the city. Instead, the following **alternative transportation methods** have developed:

- **Treadwalkers** – **Clockwork exoskeletal frames**, resembling **steam-powered stilts**, allow couriers and enforcers to ascend steep roads with ease.
- **Golemic Lifts** – Towering **arcane-powered elevators** assist movement between altitude levels, commonly found in **Penitent’s Rise** and **The Tribunal Forum**.
- **Skyferries** – Suspended **tram-like gondolas**, powered by **arcane-electric current**, ferry goods and passengers across the city’s highest districts.
- **Canal Ferries** – Many of Hellhaven’s lower districts have **waterways**, where **flat-bottomed steam skiffs** operate as **taxi services**.
<h3>Travel in the City</h3>
- **Checkpoint System** – Each district has controlled entry points where movement is monitored. Travel papers are required for **restricted areas**, such as **The Adjudicary**.
- **Curfew Enforcement** – At sundown, non-essential movement is forbidden unless sanctioned.
<h3>Entry and Reentry</h3>
- **The Gate of Submission** – The main landward entry into Hellhaven, where newcomers are interrogated and documented.
- **Brineyard Inspection Docks** – All ships must **register cargo and passengers** upon arrival. Unregistered arrivals face severe punishment.
- **The Inner Gates** – Sections of the city are separated by **gated corridors**, restricting access to sensitive areas.
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<h3>Materials</h3>
Hellhaven’s architecture is built with a mix of **local stone, imported steel, and arcane-powered lighting**:

- **Obsidian-Grey Brick & Ironwood Reinforcement** – The **foundational material** for most buildings, durable enough to withstand the **coastal gales**.
- **Arcane-Electric Streetlights** – Imported from **[[Vergrenzig]]**, these **tesla-like lamps** harness engineered magic, **emitting a steady white-blue glow**.
- **Copper-Inscribed Sigils** – Many **official buildings** feature etched symbols of **The Lord’s decree**, **warding glyphs**, and reinforcement runes.
<h3>Development</h3>
#### **1st Era: The Refuge of the Mist (Founding of Gellhafn, 400+ years ago)**

- Hellhaven, originally **Gellhafn**, was founded as a **sanctuary for refugees** fleeing the devastation of **the Elemental Storm Fallout**—a catastrophic event that left **arcane-laden mist** lingering along the coastline.
- The city’s first settlers were survivors, **building atop the ruins of a preexisting civilization**, remnants of which still exist in **Wraithmire Quarter**.

#### **2nd Era: The Rise of the Concordat (Religious Takeover, ~300 years ago)**

- **The Concordat of the Lord**, a powerful sect of **The Lord’s clergy**, arrived and **seized control of Gellhafn**, proclaiming the mist a **divine trial** to test mortal will.
- Under their rule, Gellhafn was renamed **Hellhaven**, a "bastion of order in a world of chaos."
- The **great edicts** were established: **law, obedience, and industry above all else**.

#### **3rd Era: The Industrial Reform (Trade with Vergrenzig, ~150 years ago)**

- **Vergrenzig’s steampunk innovations** reached Hellhaven, **revolutionizing shipbuilding, arcane-electric power, and mechanical craftsmanship**.
- **The Chainmoor Brine Yards and Ironclad Sprawl** expanded, turning the city into a **technological and maritime powerhouse**.
- However, **industrialization brought new tensions**, with Vergrenzig’s **free-market ideals clashing against the strict theocratic rule of The Concordat.**

#### **4th Era: The Era of Iron and Chains (Present Day)**

- Hellhaven is at **a crossroads**, torn between its **theocratic law** and the **technological advancements** reshaping society.
- The **Clergy fears losing control** over the population as innovation **challenges their monopoly on power**.
- **The Wraithmire Quarter’s mist has begun to shift unpredictably**, with reports of **strange figures** emerging from its depths—an omen of **past forces stirring once more**…
