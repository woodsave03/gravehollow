### Quick Facts

- **Front**: A reputable tinkering and repair shop specializing in ship components, automaton parts, and fine clockwork mechanisms. The sign outside reads:  
    _“Brighton’s Fix & Fiddle – Precision Repairs & Custom Craftwork.”_

>[!important]+ Overview
>- **Location**: Nestled in a dimly lit alley of the Brine Yards, squeezed between a rotting sailmaker’s loft and a derelict spice warehouse. The constant clatter of gears and hissing steam conceal hushed conversations.
>- **Access**: Customers seeking more than mechanical repairs must use the coded phrase: _“I need a tune-up for my arcane conductor.”_—only then will Brighton lead them into the hidden chamber below the shop.
>- **Hidden Chamber**: A vaulted, sea-sprayed cavern beneath the shop, where arcane trinkets float weightlessly in lantern-lit glass cases. Some items still hum with residual magic, while others seem eager to be held.

>Brighton, an Archfey warlock with an unsettling grin, runs the shop. Always impeccably dressed, with clockwork jewelry that shifts on its own, he speaks in riddles and deflects questions with humor. Those who cross him tend to vanish into the dark tides of the Chainmoor.
