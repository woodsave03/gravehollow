<h2>Invention</h2>

**Innovation Hubs:** The Laboratorium District houses inventors and researchers who develop new technologies and magical applications, blending arcane and natural elements.
**Biomagic Integration:** Everyday life features inventions that merge organic and magical materials, such as self-repairing structures and enchanted tools.
**Community Workshops:** Residents are encouraged to bring forward their own inventions, fostering a culture of grassroots innovation.

<h2>Resources</h2>
   
- **Medicinal Plants:** A rich variety of medicinal flora grows in the Glistening Canopy, providing the raw materials for the city's pharmaceutical industry.
- **Zurkhwood:** A sturdy, fast-growing megafungi used extensively in construction and crafting.
- **Bioluminescent Fungi:** Provides natural lighting and has applications in decorative and functional items.
- **Magical Spores:** Collected from the controlled borders of Hly'draug, these spores are used in biogolemancy and experimental medicine.
- **Fresh Water:** Streams flowing from the canopy and through the Undercity provide clean water.

<h3>Distribution</h3>
**Central Distribution Hubs:** Resources are collected and distributed from central points like the Agricultural District and Exomarket.
**Guilds and Collectives:** Various guilds manage specific resources, such as the Herbalist Guild for medicinal plants and the Builder's Collective for construction materials.
**Sustainable Practices:** Resource use is tightly regulated to maintain the health of the ecosystem, with quotas and periodic replenishment cycles enforced by druidic overseers.
   
<h3>Imports</h3>
   
   Any rare earth materials must be traded to settlements within the [[Glistening Canopy]] before it can be sold again to Vrellyn. Most of their sustenance and construction biomaterials are sustainably sourced from druidically-altered crops cultivated in the [[Hivedrums]]. Vrelline cuisine consists of plant-based materials, but can also include imported delicacies of seafood from harbors to the south or controversial hunters who either hunt in the swamps of [[Hly'draug]] or hide the fact that their prey resides in the protected [[Glistening Canopy]].
   
<h3>Income</h3>
   
   The merchant guild exports mainly medicines to the surrounding areas, as well as selling to merchants that travel there simply to trade for their valued medicinal products. It is not uncommon for the pharmaceutical market to find its way to Vrellyn, for there are many settlements in need, and not all Vrelline merchants are willing to brave the treacherous wilds outside the city to transport goods. This allows for merchant caravans to make a profit while charging for extra transportation fees.
