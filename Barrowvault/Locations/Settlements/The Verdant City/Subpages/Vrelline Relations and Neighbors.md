**A Mysterious Haven:** Vrellyn is known as a city of wonders, shrouded in mystery due to its hidden location within the Glistening Canopy. Outsiders regard it with a mix of awe and caution, often hearing tales of its advanced medicines, formidable defenses, and the eerie presence of biogolems.
**A Beacon of Healing:** For those in need of medical aid, Vrellyn is a beacon of hope. The city’s reputation for curing rare diseases and its mastery of botanical magic draws pilgrims and merchants alike, despite the perilous journey to reach it.
**A Place of Secrecy:** Some see Vrellyn as secretive and insular, suspicious of its reluctance to fully open its borders. Stories of the city’s internal struggles, particularly involving class disparity and the shadowy dealings of the Vrelline Undercity, paint a picture of a society grappling with its own dark undercurrents.

<h2>Trade Partners</h2>
	- **[[Irrhilm]] (Northeast)**: A neighboring settlement known for its skilled metalworkers and artisans. Vrellyn imports crafted tools and decorative metals, while exporting medicinal products and bioluminescent fungi used for lighting.
    - **[[Sauztein Geb]] (Far West)**: A larger city with thriving markets. Vrellyn trades its pharmaceuticals and rare botanicals for luxury goods, textiles, and non-perishable food items that cannot be grown locally.
    - **[[Cuirefyn]] (Underdark, Northwest)**: A subterranean city that trades in rare gems and minerals. Vrellyn exchanges its knowledge of biogolemancy and botanical medicine for precious stones and metals used in alchemical and arcane experiments.
<h2>Allies</h2>
    - **The Verdant Pact**: A coalition of druidic enclaves within the Glistening Canopy, united in their mission to preserve the forest’s natural beauty and magical properties. They support Vrellyn in protecting the region from external threats like Hly'draug.
    - **The Circle of Luminaries**: A loose network of scholars and mages who admire Vrellyn’s advancements in biogolemancy and medicine. They often collaborate on research and provide mutual support in intellectual pursuits.
    - Smaller settlements within the [[Glistening Canopy]] commonly trade with Vrellyn within the woods, and are the few settlements that know the location of Vrellyn. Settlements external to the forest are unaware of its exact location, but hear legend of the druidic miracles that are conducted there.
<h2>Enemies</h2>
    - **The Queen of Rot**: The primary antagonist from Hly'draug, leading an ever-expanding army of corrupted beings. Her goal is to consume and corrupt the Glistening Canopy, making Vrellyn a crucial target.
    - **The Sporeshroud Coven:** A cult whose beliefs include the worship of the Queen of Rot, venerating the spread of decay as a divine transformation. They see the fungal infection as a gift that unites all life into a singular, perfect organism under the Queen's control.
    - **The [[Blackthorn Consortium]]**: A rogue faction of merchants and alchemists who have been banished from Vrellyn due to unethical practices. They harbor a deep grudge and seek to undermine the city’s economy by spreading counterfeit medicines and poisonous substances in nearby regions.
    - **[[Hellhaven]] (Far North)**: A shadowy realm ruled by despots who view Vrellyn’s independence and progressive values as a threat to their control. They fund covert operations to destabilize the city’s leadership and exploit its resources.
<h2>Neighbours</h2>
	- **[[Thornmire]] (East of Hly'draug)**: A frontier town that serves as a buffer against the spread of the rot. Its inhabitants are hardy and resourceful, specializing in crafting anti-fungal remedies and defensive charms. They maintain a cautious alliance with Vrellyn, relying on the city’s expertise while providing early warnings of Hly'draug’s movements.
	- **[[Luthadel]] (Betwixt of Twin Rivers)**: A riverine settlement that thrives on fishing and trade. Known for its shipwrights and navigators, it maintains strong trade ties with Vrellyn, providing access to coastal goods and fresh seafood in exchange for medicinal supplies.
	- **[[Sylvanreach]] (Drakonspyne Foothills)**: A secluded enclave of fey-touched humans and genasi who practice ancient elemental magic. They share a cultural and mystical bond with Vrellyn, collaborating on magical research and mutual defense against external threats.
