<h2>Symbolism</h2>

>[!important]+ Emblem 
>The emblem of Vrellyn features a **giant tree with glowing, bioluminescent leaves**, representing the Glistening Canopy. The roots intertwine with the silhouette of a **biogolem**, symbolizing the unity of nature and magic. The background showcases a crescent moon, reflecting the city’s connection to the fey and its mystical atmosphere.

>[!important]+ Mascot
>The **Leafdrake**, a small, winged creature with a leafy body, is the unofficial mascot. Revered for its gentle nature and its role in pollinating the canopy, it embodies the harmony between the city's flora and fauna.

<h2>Settlement Leaders</h2>
Vrellyn is led by a combination of academic, civic, economic, and military powers. This Scholarly Oligarchy is structured to be weighted towards the decisions of the [[Council of Healers]] and [[Pharmopol]], balanced by the legal and cultural considerations of the [[Harmonium of Lore]], and checked by the [[Merchant Guild of Vital Trades]]' input regarding the economy. During external crisis or invasion, [[Phamopol]] is authorized to implement reactive defensive measures. These decisions can later be sent to the other branches to be approved.

The [[Council of Healers]] oversees major health policies, the regulation of pharmaceutical products, and the sanctioning of medical research. During public health crises, they manage the addressal of outbreaks and advancements against the rot of [[Hly'draug]].

As a defense organization, [[Pharmopol]] maintains the integrity of the Glistening Canopy outer edges through pruning and disinfectants. They are also responsible for conducting reconnaissance and countermeasure expeditions into [[Hly'draug]].

Through an elected representative, the [[Merchant Guild of Vital Trades]] reviews any proposed legislations to ensure the needs of the economy are voiced: balancing the fine line between quarantined isolation and becoming cut off from the world's resources. Outside of the oligarchy, the merchant guild oversees a steady flow of imports, trade of medical supplies, and the acquisition of overseas customers.

The heart of the scholarly oligarchy, the [[Harmonium of Lore]], is the history and soul of the government. This branch ensures those who govern Vrellyn remain true to its roots and traditions, keeping the city's long-term vision of precaution and ecologic ethical standards.

>[!example]+ Legislation and Cultural Preservation
>The [[Harmonium of Lore]] preserves Vrellyn's culture and history through legislation and documentation of rites and rituals. Below are some pieces of lore and law that allow the spirit of Vrellyn to persevere through crisis and centuries.
>## Cultural Legislation and Practices
>>[!cite]- Festival of Vital Bloom
>>   
>>   This festival marks the peak of growth for the city's main production: medicinal herbs. The celebrations honor the druids and biomancers whose wisdom and revelations have saved countless lives against the seeping infection of the [[Queen of Rot]]. The pertinent legislation includes instructional manuals regarding sustainable practices to be utilized during workshops that educate the younger generation of ethical practices when harvesting plants.
>
>>[!cite]- Rites of Passage for Healers
>>
>> This ceremony is a formal induction for graduates of the [[Vrelline College of Horticulture and Biomancy]] that signifies their readiness to serve in an extension of either the [[Council of Healers]] or [[Pharmopol]]. The existing legislation requires that graduates complete a year of service in either the city's various free clinics or under the tutelage of governmental research teams before being allowed to establish an independent practice.
>## Historical Preservation
>>[!cite]- Chronicles of the Tenechron
>>
>>Those historians who survived the exodus to the [[Kagecombs]], after the apocalyptic storms of Tenechron, kept themselves busy with the documentation of survival practices and emergency technique learned during travel through the unfamiliar maze of caverns. These records also include what scouts could glean was occurring on the surface, and speculate at the cause of the elemental storms. These lessons allowed Vrellyn to learn from its newfound resources within the caves beneath its surface, expanding its reach underground and harnessing the symbiotic capabilities of the native fungi in the effort towards harmonizing architecture with the surrounding ecosystem.
>
>>[!cite]- Tales of the Ancient Treants
>>
>>This collection of scrolls and woven tablets has been protected by the very first leaders of the historic preservation movement that led to the establishment of the [[Harmonium of Lore]], passed down from the original treant elders to the high druids that once led the early development of the Vrelline settlement. However, some of this ancient wisdom was only passed down by word of mouth, and between this and the translation of ancient Sylvan dialects, many of these tales have been received as fabular, leaving each tale's level of truth to be up to interpretation.
>## Legal Framework
>>[!cite]- Regulation of Biogolemancy
>>
>>This group of legislative documents recount the various regulations and laws pertaining to the creation and use of biogolems, ensuring both ethicality and safety to themselves and those around them. These guidelines provide strict limitations regarding the experimentation and patenting of biogolems, requiring all golem designs be registered and inspected by [[Pharmopol]] on a regular basis.
>
>>[!cite]- Anti-Plague Measures
>>
>>With the threat of fungal infection outbreaks on the horizon at all times, legislation was required to unite the populace against the spread of [[Hly'draug]]. This documentation includes information about quarantine measures, the enforcement of the use of air masks, and penalties for violating such countermeasures.
>
>>[!cite]- Black Market Oversight
>>
>>In more current events, a response towards the recent uprisings against the distribution and testing of unsanctioned drugs through illicit trade. Enforced by the merchants' guild, this law's goal is to ensure that dangerous and experimental drugs are kept from the open market, and that only approved drugs are introduced to the public. The law also defines legal practices used when handling drug-related crimes, including topics regarding justice and rehabilitation.
>## Cultural Lore and Traditions
>>[!cite]- Songs of the Canopy
>>
>>A collection of ancestral songs performed during community events and ceremonies, the origins of which are muddled with the passage of time. Some have not been translated, their melodic vocalization being the only memory of their existence, devoid of diction. Some religious sects believe them to have ancient celestial meaning, but they remain a jumble of vowels on paper. Many of the tunes have been repurposed with updated lyrics, then taught in schools to foster cultural identity and unity among the citizenry.
>
>>[!cite]- Legends of the Glistening Sentinels
>>
>>A group of upstanding citizens have become immortalized within the Halls of Reflection where the [[Harmonium of Lore]] are headquartered. Their stories are woven with fact and fiction, but their accomplishments are what children aspiring to when pursuing government positions; teaching them to present with pride and vigilance in their education and societal contributions. These heroes of yore are incorporated into education and public ceremonies, inspiring many to seek an alcove among them within the Halls of Reflection.

<h2>Crime</h2>
There is crime within Vrellyn, the most impactful being due to unsanctioned trial testing of drugs before they have been released to market. This is highly illegal but it is how upstart and/or desperate pharmacologists gain footing within the industry. These tests are targeted towards the poor, homeless, preexisting addicts, and incarcerated criminals. Since the target groups are already in a state of misfortune, this particular flavor of crime ensures that that class of people remains on the bottom rungs of society. 

Additionally, there are those that seek the sale of performance-enhancing drugs that assist in the conducting of illicit activities. These drugs are often used as a way to avoid incarceration, either by enhancing their ability to fight local authorities, or avoid them entirely.

The Merchant's Guild themself is also corrupt. To take advantage of the economy, they have taken up the habit of eliminating competitors and stealing the fresh ideas of budding pharmacologists. Using the mutative properties of much of the biomaterials they collect from [[Hly'draug]], they have created efficient monstrous assassins that can be used to look like these deaths were accidents from the dangerous borderlands of Vrellyn. In order to complete the picture, the Merchant's Guild must first be ever vigilant to the illegal doings of these upstarts, waiting for an opportune moment to release their attack dogs on them. This allows the Guild to keep up appearances for the crack-down on crime, while also benefitting from the "accidental deaths" of these promising new scientists. These attacks usually occur during exchanges of product outside the city walls, where the exchange is less likely to be witnessed by the authorities, and more likely to be interrupted by a stray fungal monstrosity.
