<h2>Language</h2>
**Common (Umbrean Dialect):** The primary language used for communication across the city and with traders from other regions.
**Sylvan:** Widely spoken due to the fey influence, used in rituals, formal ceremonies, and among the more traditional or scholarly citizens.
**Druidic:** Spoken by the druids and those closely connected to nature’s magic, used in private or sacred contexts.
**Undertongue:** A variant of Common with influences from the Underdark, spoken mainly in the Hivedrums and by those involved in underground dealings.

<h3>Dialects and Accents</h3>
**Vrellian Accent:** A soft, melodic intonation influenced by the rhythm of Sylvan. Words are often elongated, with a lilt at the end of sentences, reflecting the city's tranquil and mystical atmosphere. The accent is more pronounced in those who spend time in the upper canopy, while Hivedrum residents have a more clipped and practical speech pattern, reflecting their harsher environment.
<h2>Developmental Impacts</h2>

- **Geographical Isolation:**
    - Vrellyn’s location within the dense and magical [[Glistening Canopy]] has shaped its development into a self-sufficient and heavily fortified city. Its isolation has fostered a strong sense of community but also limited its exposure to outside cultural influences, creating a unique but insular society.
- **Historical Conflicts:**
    - The city's history of plagues and invasions, particularly during the [[Gnosichron]] and [[Tenechron]], has led to a culture of resilience and innovation. These events forced Vrellyn to develop advanced medical and defensive technologies, which continue to influence its focus on biogolemancy and sustainable living.
- **Fey Influence:**
    - The proximity to fey realms has infused the city with an element of whimsy and unpredictability. The fey’s capricious nature has left a lasting impact on Vrellyn’s architecture, festivals, and even its legal system, which often includes clauses for dealing with magical mishaps and fey interventions.
- **Economic Disparities:**
    - The division between the affluent surface dwellers and the struggling inhabitants of the Hivedrums has led to social tensions that shape political and economic policies. The growing discontent and potential for rebellion have become a significant factor in the city’s internal politics, influencing how resources are allocated and who holds power.
- **Magical Anomalies:**
    - The presence of [[Yphrhei]] and other ancient entities within the [[Glistening Canopy]] has created areas of unpredictable magical phenomena. These anomalies have made certain parts of the city and surrounding forest treacherous but also rich in arcane knowledge and resources, attracting scholars and adventurers despite the risks.


<h2>Culture</h2>
**Pride and Reverence:** Most Vrellians take great pride in their city’s accomplishments, particularly in its medical advancements and harmonious integration with nature. They view Vrellyn as a beacon of hope and a testament to what can be achieved through cooperation and respect for the natural world.
**Awareness of Struggles:** While many appreciate the beauty and innovation of the city, there is an undercurrent of tension regarding the social divide. Those in the Hivedrums are often more critical of the city’s leadership and seek greater equality and recognition.
**Guarded Optimism:** The city’s proximity to the dangers of Hly'draug and the constant threat of external forces means that its citizens live with a sense of vigilance. However, their connection to the land and its protective magic gives them a cautious but hopeful outlook on the future.

<h3>Cuisine</h3>
**Eclectic Cuisine:** The local diet incorporates a wide array of plant-based ingredients, reflecting the city’s rich biodiversity and the inhabitants’ appreciation for natural flavors.

<h3>Rich/Poor Gap</h3>

There is a large rich/poor gap, and there is a geographical gap as well. Those who are of higher class and individual importance to the city live above-ground, where there are limited structures and space for the city sprawl. With a hard border protecting Vrellyn from [[Hly'draug]], and the challenge of expansion without damaging the biome excessively so as not to weaken their natural border defenses. This has raised the costs of developing new surfaceland housing, causing the poorer classes to reside below in the [[Kagecombs]]. In the undercity below, there are preexisting dwellings from during the [[Tenechron]]; this particular location was historically chosen due to its natural skylight exit and simultaneous freshwater river entrance into the water table below.

<h3>Outsiders</h3>
The outsiders of Vrellyn include the following demographics: dwarves, fey-descended humans, and gnomes. Integrating into the close-knit and isolated community that is Vrellian society is a slow and cautious process. Its insular nature makes moving to the Verdant City a feat at the easiest, but never a hostile experience. Skill and civic contribution is valued, and is often the key to finding a place among the community.

Most Vrellian dwarves descend from the clan of dwarves that assisted the subterranean refugees during the Tenechron after fleeing their own home to the northeast. Those who decided to stay in Vrellyn during the Luxichron are those who live there today. With them, they brought their ancestral craft and skills in masonry. Much of the development in the [[Hivedrums]] was done by this clan.

Gnome-kind throughout Umbrea became aware of Vrellyn's expertise in medicine and chemistry after [[Cuirefyn]] revealed its ancestral ties to The Verdant City. Each gnomish settlement sent emissaries to learn these crafts, and many remained to put down roots and continue pursuing their interest. Originally these emissaries found residence in the Laboratorium District. 

Some folk prefer the ambient presence of constant threat over the looming presence threat of happenstance. Some just want to reconnect to their faerie roots. Thus, fey-descended humanoids have come to seek refuge and a consistent life inside the Emerald Wall. Often, they integrate themselves into society first through the pursuit of education, followed by engagement with the civic cogs that keep the city safe and running.
