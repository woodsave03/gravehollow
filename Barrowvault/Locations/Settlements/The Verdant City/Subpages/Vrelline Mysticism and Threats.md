The founders knew of the potential held by the mutations within [[Hly'draug]], but needed a barrier between the monstrosities that lurked within and their home. Creating an outpost within the [[Glistening Canopy]] allowed them to monitor the spread of the swamp's influence, as well as reinforce the border between the two biomes. This way they could conduct analysis from afar while still having easy access to sampling of biomaterials.

<h2>Adaptation to Threats</h2>

The main threat to Vrellyn is [[Hly'draug]] to the south. This swampland has been infected by spores originating from the [[Underdark]], making the creatures under its control a hierarchical hive mind. Each infected creature is connected to both its infector's mind, as well as those that it infects directly. When infected, a creature is overridden by these fungal growths, functionally killing the host but preserving its physical capabilities, if not enhancing them through mutagens meant to adapt to the swamp's environment. These mutations make the infected lethal hunters within this biome, as the flora and fauna that make up its existence have become allies to each of the infected creatures residing within.

The inhabitants of Vrellyn have adapted to this through the creation of natural filtration. Through the combination of artifice and biomancy, the [[Council of Healers]] created what are simply called air masks.

> ### Vrelline Air Masks
> By allowing an arcanely-enhanced local vine to grow over a filtration mesh, the aromatic and dermis excretions of the vine neutralize any airborne spores and infectants. Instead, the microscopic dermis excretions take the hit, becoming infected by any intake of infectants, then they soon after die off after being separated from the vine. The biomancy becomes prevalent at this point in the process, essentially cauterizing the dead biomass as soon as it dies, ensuring that any infectants are deceased as well before they are ingested by the mask wearer.

>While the wearer of the air mask has it donned, the creature has advantage on saving throws against airborne poisons and diseases that the mask was NOT specifically created for. The creature also has immunity from the airborne infectant it WAS created for. In addition, the wearer has resistance to poison damage that is applied through an airborne cloud or other inhalant.
>
>***Cursed Object.*** If this mask is worn consistently enough (i.e. 8 hrs per day consecutively for a year), then the wearer becomes dependent on its filtration properties. Once the humanoid creature has adapted to rely on the clean air provided by the air mask, it becomes vulnerable to other infections when the creature is not wearing the mask. While the mask is doffed, the cursed creature has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws against disease and the poisoned condition. In addition, they are vulnerable to poison damage while the mask is doffed. 

Additionally, [[Pharmopol]] has begun to harness the animative properties of the [[Hly'draug]] spores. Through them, more agile and autonomous arcane golems have been developed. Many Vrelline golemancers believe that the spores have revolutionized the creation of autonomous golems. These golems are often assigned to security posts within the city, but are also known to accompany excursions into [[Hly'draug]] when research calls for further samples or city safety calls for scouting missions to assess the threat-level of the borders of the swamp.

<h2>Arcane Integration</h2>

**Everyday Enhancements:** Magic is a fundamental part of life in Vrellyn, with enchantments woven into daily activities. Streetlights are bioluminescent fungi enhanced with minor illumination spells, and public spaces often feature ambient sound-dampening enchantments to create serene environments.
**Integrated Infrastructure:** Buildings are supported by magical growth spells that encourage structures made from Zurkhwood to self-repair and adapt to environmental changes. Magical wards protect the city from external threats, particularly from the encroaching rot of Hly'draug.
**Biogolem Assistance:** Golems imbued with arcane energy are used for various tasks, from guarding the city to assisting in agricultural activities. These biogolems are a blend of magic and nature, reflecting the city's innovative spirit.

<h2>Religion</h2>

**Pantheon of Nature Spirits:** Vrellyn’s primary spiritual focus is on the worship of nature spirits and fey deities. Temples and shrines dedicated to these entities are scattered throughout the city, often integrated into natural settings like groves or ponds.
**Seasonal Festivals:** Major rites and festivals align with the changing seasons, celebrating the cycles of nature. The **Festival of Vital Bloom** and the **Harvest of Light** are significant events that involve the entire community.
**Personal Rites:** Citizens often have private altars in their homes or gardens, where they perform daily rituals to honor the spirits and seek blessings for health and prosperity.
