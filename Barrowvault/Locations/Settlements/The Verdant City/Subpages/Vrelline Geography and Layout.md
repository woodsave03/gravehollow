<h2>Layout</h2>
**Organic Layout:** Dwellings in Vrellyn follow an organic pattern, spreading out from central hubs like the College District and Exomarket. Houses are often multi-level, with the upper floors built into the canopy of the trees and lower levels extending underground.
**Clustered Communities:** Homes are grouped into clusters around communal spaces like gardens or water sources, fostering a sense of community. The architecture is deeply intertwined with the natural landscape, using living plants as part of the structure.
**Adaptive Designs:** Homes are designed to adapt to their inhabitants' needs, with spaces that can shift or grow over time thanks to magical and botanical integration. These dwellings often feature hanging gardens, integrated moss insulation, and vine-covered facades.

<h3>Planning</h3>
**Partially Planned:** While the original settlement grew organically, modern Vrellyn has undergone careful planning, especially after major events like the [[Tenechron]]. The central districts like the College District and Exomarket are well-planned, with efficient layouts to support trade and education.
**Adaptive Planning:** The city’s planners work closely with druids and biomancers to ensure that expansion or redevelopment projects respect the natural flow of the environment. This results in a balance between planned infrastructure and organic growth, allowing the city to remain flexible and resilient.

<h2>Thoroughfares</h2>

Vrellyn’s thoroughfares are designed to blend seamlessly with the natural environment. The city’s streets and pathways are often winding and interconnected, painting an impression of the Glistening Canopy’s roots and branches.

**Main Arteries:** The primary roads are broad and well-maintained, lined with bioluminescent plants that provide natural lighting. These lead to key districts like the [[College District]], [[Agricultural District]], and [[Exomarket]].
**Canopy Paths:** Elevated walkways and rope bridges crisscross the upper levels of the city, allowing for efficient travel between areas perched on the massive trees of the Glistening Canopy. These paths are crucial for navigating the verticality of the city.
**Subways:** The Vrelline Undercity features a network of tunnels and caverns that connect various underground dwellings and workspaces, providing a sheltered alternative to surface travel.

<h3>Modes of Travel</h3>

**On Foot:** Given the city’s compact nature and integration with the forest, most residents travel on foot. The abundance of footpaths makes walking the easiest way to get around.
**Beast-Drawn Carriages:** For transporting goods or those who prefer a less strenuous mode of travel, carriages drawn by domesticated plant or animal hybrids are used. These are common in the market and agricultural districts.
**Glider Systems:** For longer distances or to quickly traverse the vertical spaces of the city, residents use personal or communal gliders. These devices, often made from lightweight wood and enchanted fabrics, allow for a quick descent from higher areas to lower ones.
**Golem Transport:** Larger, mechanical biogolems are used for heavy lifting and transportation of bulk goods. These golems are designed to navigate both the streets and canopy paths efficiently.
**Canopy Lifts:** Elevator-like platforms powered by a combination of magic and natural forces (e.g., vine growth mechanisms) connect the ground level with the canopy. They are used for moving people and goods between the different levels of the city.
**Waterways:** In the Undercity, waterways fed by underground streams provide a mode of travel via small boats. These ferries are essential for transporting goods within the subterranean sections of the city.
**Spiral Stairways:** Carved directly into the massive trunks of the Glistening Canopy trees, these stairways offer a more direct and physically demanding route for those who prefer or require a slower descent.

<h3>Travel in the City</h3>

**Vertical Expansion:** After the [[Tenechron]], the city has thrived and been motivated to use the caverns below to expand its real estate. Alongside this expansion, their culture of protecting the ecology around them has ensured they design any vertical expansion to harmonize with the jungle around them. The availability of glider systems and canopy lifts has allowed Vrellyn to expand upwards into the towering trees of the Glistening Canopy, maximizing space without disrupting the delicate ecosystem.
**Trade Efficiency:** The combination of beast-drawn carriages, golem transports, and waterways ensures that trade within the city is efficient. This has supported the growth of the Exomarket and allowed Vrellyn to become a hub for medicinal goods.
**Community Connectivity:** The organic layout of the thoroughfares, coupled with the elevated paths and natural lighting, fosters a sense of connectedness among residents. The transportation system encourages communal interaction and accessibility.

<h3>Entry and Reentry</h3>

**Secrecy and Protection:** Vrellyn’s hidden nature makes leaving and re-entering the city a controlled process. The city is well-concealed within the [[Glistening Canopy]], with only a few known entry points.
**Restricted Access:** Entrances to the city are guarded, and travelers must pass through security checks to prevent the spread of infection from [[Hly'draug]]. Visitors are rare, and those who do enter are typically required to have a local sponsor or purpose.
**Ease for Residents:** For Vrellians, leaving the city is relatively straightforward through known and safe routes. However, re-entering requires adherence to strict quarantine protocols, especially for those returning from expeditions to [[Hly'draug]] or other potentially hazardous areas.
**Outsider Challenges:** Outsiders find it challenging to locate Vrellyn without guidance. The city’s paths are well-hidden, and natural barriers such as dense vegetation and magical wards deter uninvited guests.


<h2>Architecture</h2>
<h3>Materials</h3>
- **Zurkhwood:** Primary material for both structural and decorative purposes.
- **Natural Stone:** Quarried from the Undercity and used for foundations and pathways.
- **Bioluminescent Fungi:** Incorporated into walls and ceilings for illumination.
- **Vines and Moss:** Used for reinforcement and aesthetic purposes, integrating buildings with the natural environment.

The surface dwellings majorly consist of an [[Underdark]] megafungi called [[Zurkhwood]]. This cultivated resource allows for the incorporation of biological integration into the surface structures of Vrellyn. This allows architecture to be supported by and integrated into the local arboreal flora, as well as support hanging gardens along their exterior surfaces. Because of this, moss and vines play a large role in the decorational and functional aspects of the architecture in Vrellyn. It is not uncommon to use hanging strands to create passable barriers within households since most of the city is already protected from weather by the forest canopy.

<h3>Development</h3>

Various parts of the city have been redeveloped over time. The Undercity was significantly expanded during the Tenechron, creating new living spaces and fortifications. Surface areas have seen renovations to adapt to new threats and advancements in biogolemancy.

**Sustainable Growth:** Redevelopment projects prioritize sustainability, ensuring that new constructions or renovations enhance the natural environment rather than disrupt it. This approach has led to a cityscape that feels both ancient and forward-looking.

<h3>Landmarks</h3>

The [[Vrelline College of Horticulture and Biomancy]] stands as tall as the megaflora arborea that the forest is known for.

<h2>Climate</h2>
Vrellyn’s dense canopy and magical enhancements create a unique microclimate. The thick foliage and water features regulate temperature, keeping the city cooler during the day and warmer at night. The magical wards help maintain this balance, making the city an oasis of stability amidst the unpredictable weather of the surrounding regions.

**Controlled Humidity:** The canopy captures and redistributes moisture, leading to consistent humidity that supports the lush plant life. This microclimate is crucial for the growth of the medicinal plants that the city relies on.
