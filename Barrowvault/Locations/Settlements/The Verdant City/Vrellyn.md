> [!info]+ History and Lore
>  The first settlers of the area were further south, along the border of [[Hly'draug]] during the [[Gnosichron]]. Before the swamp was infested by infection, it was a thriving ecosystem of medicinal flora and awakened fauna. In fact, it was one of the few locations in which the ancestors of the ancient race of treants resided. Their collective wisdom of the area attracted druidic priests and healers, whose services attracted the accumulation of a community.
   >
>   The proximity to the swamp during the initial period of infection caused there to be an outbreak of [[The Plague]], which is an early iteration of the symptoms occurring from fungal infection from the [[Kagecombs]]. The settlement was quarantined and abandoned, leaving the meager few who appeared to be uninfected to find shelter within the [[Glistening Canopy]]. The ancient treants were unable to escape with the rest of the town, but they imparted a final incantation unto the druids, who would later use it to reinforce the [[Glistening Canopy]] from the spread of the [[Hly'draug]]. 
  > 
>   This settlement was abandoned a second time during the [[Tenechron]]. Most residents found their way towards settlements far away from old [[Vrellyn]], including a large group that traveled northwest to find the [[Kagecombs]] marshland below [[Cuirefyn]]. Other storm refugees from [[Sauztein Geb]] and [[Irrhilm]] discovered a large cavern below the [[Glistening Canopy]], where a stream empties into the caverns below. The appeal of this location was not only its access to relatively fresh water, but also the occasional shafts of sunlight that would reach through the Tenechronian storm clouds and down the stream entrance. This settlement would become a permanent extension of the modern city of [[Vrellyn]].

<h2>Current Events</h2>
#### **Rising Shadows: The Hivedrums Uprising**

- **Current Event:** Growing discontent brews in the Hivedrums as rumors spread about illegal testing of experimental drugs on its residents by corrupt chemists affiliated with **Pharmopol Laboratories**. The economic disparity between the surface-dwelling elite and the impoverished Undercity inhabitants has reached a boiling point. A rebel group known as **The Verdant Reclaimers** has formed, aiming to expose the corrupt practices of the city's leadership and seek justice for those exploited.

- **Story Hook:** The party is approached by a member of The Verdant Reclaimers, who seeks their help in gathering evidence against the corrupt officials and chemists. The group must infiltrate secret laboratories in the Undercity, uncover incriminating documents, and rally the oppressed citizens to rise against their exploiters. As the rebellion gains momentum, the party must navigate the ethical dilemmas of supporting an uprising that could lead to significant civil unrest, all while facing powerful adversaries who seek to maintain the status quo.

#### **The Whispering Moths: Yphrhei’s Influence**

- **Current Event:** Deep in the heart of Hly'draug, an ancient and omniscient fey entity known as **Yphrhei** is trapped within a colossal tree of moths. The tree’s enchanted branches prevent Yphrhei from directly influencing the world, but it communicates with those who venture near, weaving their desires into a larger, hidden agenda. The party's warlock, who has a pact with Yphrhei, begins receiving cryptic messages that seem to offer solutions to their pressing problems—curing the barbarian’s Hyde Disease, locating lost arcanists for the artificer, and potentially defeating the Queen of Rot.

- **Story Hook:** The party is drawn to Hly'draug to seek Yphrhei’s guidance, but each answer they receive subtly manipulates events toward the entity’s freedom. They must balance their need for Yphrhei’s knowledge with the growing realization that their actions might be paving the way for a greater catastrophe. The players must decide whether to continue seeking Yphrhei's aid or find another path to achieve their goals, all while contending with the dangers of Hly'draug and the Queen of Rot’s looming threat.

#### **Unsealing the Wardstones**

- **Yphrhei’s Answer:** “In the stone circle beneath the whispering trees, you will find the knowledge to cleanse the Hyde Disease.”
    
- **Unintended Consequence:** The stone circle is a dormant sealing site, one of several that bind Yphrhei’s prison. The party's tampering with the ancient wardstones to access the knowledge weakens the protective seals, inadvertently loosening the fey entity's bonds.
    
- **Adventure Hook:** The party must decipher an ancient druidic language to activate the stones and retrieve a cure for Hyde Disease. As they do, they awaken slumbering guardians who reveal that the wardstones are critical to maintaining Yphrhei’s containment. The party must balance their desire to cure the barbarian against the risk of weakening Yphrhei’s prison.
    

#### **2. The Arcanists’ Legacy**

- **Yphrhei’s Answer:** “The arcanists you seek dwell in the ruins where shadows dance, their power entwined with the echoes of fate.”
    
- **Unintended Consequence:** The ruins contain ancient relics linked to Yphrhei’s prison, and the arcanists have been lured there by the entity’s whispers. Rescuing the arcanists or using their knowledge begins unraveling the delicate magical network keeping Yphrhei contained.
    
- **Adventure Hook:** The party ventures to the ruins to find the arcanists, facing traps and illusions designed to mislead intruders. As they navigate the ruins, they uncover that the arcanists were unwitting pawns in a scheme to weaken the barriers around Yphrhei’s tree. The party must decide whether to trust the arcanists or seek alternative means to strengthen the containment.
    

#### **3. The Queen of Rot’s Bargain**

- **Yphrhei’s Answer:** “The Queen of Rot fears the light of the canopy, hidden in a grove of eternal dusk. Strike there, and you shall cripple her.”
    
- **Unintended Consequence:** The grove is one of the few remaining places where Yphrhei’s influence is limited. By attacking the Queen of Rot there, the party unwittingly disrupts the balance, allowing Yphrhei’s influence to spread further into the swamp.
    
- **Adventure Hook:** The party launches an assault on the Queen of Rot’s forces in the grove, only to discover that their actions have destabilized the area. With Yphrhei’s reach growing stronger, they must seek out allies among the fey to contain the spread of its influence, creating a precarious alliance that could backfire.
    

#### **4. Threads of Fate**

- **Yphrhei’s Answer:** “In the loom of destiny, a thread once pulled can unravel the tapestry. Seek the thread of the skyborn star, and your path will be made clear.”
    
- **Unintended Consequence:** The party is guided to a celestial artifact that holds the power to reshape reality, a fragment of Yphrhei’s former power. Using it gives the party a significant advantage but also furthers Yphrhei’s goal of reuniting with its lost essence, bringing it closer to freedom.
    
- **Adventure Hook:** The artifact allows the party to manipulate events in their favor, but each use draws them deeper into Yphrhei’s web. As they rely more on the artifact, they begin to notice subtle shifts in their surroundings—whispers in the wind, shadows moving in unnatural patterns. They must choose whether to continue using the artifact or seek a way to destroy it before Yphrhei can reclaim it fully.
    

#### **5. The Moth’s Lament**

- **Yphrhei’s Answer:** “To weave the silk of salvation, you must find the Moth’s Lament, a song sung only by those who have walked the path of despair.”
    
- **Unintended Consequence:** The song is a ritual that, when performed, weakens the barrier between Yphrhei’s prison and the material world. The party’s quest to learn the song inadvertently triggers a series of events that make the barrier more permeable.
    
- **Adventure Hook:** The party must seek out a reclusive hermit who knows the Moth’s Lament. As they learn the song, they begin experiencing visions of Yphrhei’s past, subtly influenced to see the entity as a benevolent force. They must uncover the true nature of the song and decide whether to use it, risking further weakening the prison or finding another way to achieve their goals.

#### **Echoes of the Ancients: The Lost Treant Incantation**

- **Current Event:** A long-lost incantation from the ancient treants, said to hold the power to reinforce the protective barriers of the Glistening Canopy, has resurfaced in fragments. The fragments are scattered across Vrellyn, guarded by secretive factions and hidden within ancient ruins. The rediscovery of this incantation could bolster the city’s defenses against Hly'draug, but its misuse might also unleash unintended consequences.
    
- **Story Hook:** The party is hired by the [[Pharmopol]] to recover the incantation fragments. As they delve into the city's past, they uncover a conspiracy involving the **Harmonium of Lore**, who seek to keep the incantation hidden due to a prophecy foretelling its misuse. The party must navigate the city’s political tensions, ancient traps, and magical puzzles to piece together the incantation, deciding whether to use it to strengthen the city’s defenses or destroy it to prevent a possible disaster.

### Prompt Summary

Vrellyn is a secluded city hidden within the Glistening Canopy of Umbrea, known for its mastery of medicine, biogolemancy, and sustainable magic. It is a city shaped by the delicate balance between nature and arcane innovation, with a strong fey influence and a constant threat from the nearby Hly'draug Swamp, home to the Queen of Rot. Vrellyn's society is divided, with affluent scholars and healers living in the surface districts, while the lower-class inhabitants of the Hivedrums—the city's undercity—face exploitation and harsh conditions. The city's leadership consists of an oligarchy led by factions like the Council of Healers and the Merchant Guild of Vital Trades, with growing unrest fueled by groups like the Verdant Reclaimers. Vrellyn maintains cautious trade with neighboring settlements but remains secretive and self-reliant, wary of outsiders and the creeping corruption from Hly'draug.
