A showdown for the ages. The garden is much more alive than the one outside the mansion. The hag awaits there. The battle can go one of many ways. 
	1. Everyone turns on each other because of the deals set up (if gone down that path). The hag will watch in delighted amusement with her rat friends, eating a bucket of eyeballs like popcorn and throwing out quips or weird suggestions. 
	2. Everyone fights against the hag. 
	3. You can “save” the hag through persuasion checks. By revealing the past of Annabelle, you are able to make persuasion checks and bring back the hag’s memories and restore her humanity. The amount of successful checks is up to the dm. However, if the players get 3 rolls 5 and under, the hag will unleash The Entity.
	4. The party splits, those that break their pact suffer the consequences and the ones who adhere to it will be respected by the owner of the Manor, who may even help in the fight.

An area within the [[Dealing Manor]]. This battle will take place in the Manor's demiplane, as Annabelle will put all the characters to sleep to astral project into a demiplane that appears to take place in the Moonshae Isles, but on a much smaller scale, as characters tower over the isles and conduct their battle there. This area can only be accessed in the final iteration of the [[Hallway]].
