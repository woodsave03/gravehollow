A kitchen, far cleaner than the rest of the house. There is a small table, a wood oven, a few marble counters, some cabinets underneath, and an icebox. A slotted pantry door stands in the wall to the left. 
- Opening the cabinet where Venarious Sullac used to be (skeleton?) would cause an alarm to sound off, summoning monsters from the back room. In the oven, one would find a picture of a child, carefully drawn with the eyes scribbled out. The icebox is full of fresh meat of an “indiscernible source.” 
	- An arcana check would reveal it has magic origins.
	- Opening the cabinet with let out a small group of Darklings that had been living there.

A room within the [[Dealing Manor]]. The icebox sits ontop of a trapdoor that leads to the [[Puzzle Room]]. The "pantry" leads to the [[Hallway]].
