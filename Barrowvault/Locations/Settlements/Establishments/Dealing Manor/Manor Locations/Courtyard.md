Rain-soaked grass lies before you with a smattering of puddles that reflect rippled and distorted views of the outer manor walls that rise up from every direction. A fountain stands motionless in the center, a circular stone base that comes up to the hip holds cloudy water. Several heaps litter the surrounding area, and on closer inspection of the one nearest you, they seem to be the rotting corpses of those who have passed through here once before. The moisture in the air only worsens the stench, and you find yourself covering your mouth and nose instinctually.

Inside the dormant water fountain lies a Lampad in waiting. If the water is disturbed, the Lampad will grapple a character and transport it to a nearby corpse, where Daewynn will speak to them through.

An area within the [[Dealing Manor]]. Exiting from where they came will lead a character to the [[Puzzle Room]].
