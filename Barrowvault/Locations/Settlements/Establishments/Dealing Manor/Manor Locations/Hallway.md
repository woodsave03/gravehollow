The hallway is as simple as it gets, but there is something haunting about it. Rows of armor line the hallway, most seeming to be charred, tarnished or torn. Upon inspection, one set of armor will have the words “T.H.” engraved in it, and another will have “S.H.” engraved. Windows are scattered in between each display, the patter of rain persistent in its assault on the glass. Flashes of light in the clouds threaten to bring raucous thunder.

A room within the [[Dealing Manor]]. At the end of the hall is a door, which has an equal chance of leading a character to the [[Bathroom]], [[Agatha's Bedroom]], the [[Courtyard]], and the Hallway again. Ruz will be sent to a pocket plane within the Manor's domain and converse with Yphrhei itself to make a deal and receive instructions. He will reappear when convenient.

The hallway may also be accessed through a round window from the [[Attic]], entering the hallway by breaking in from the outside. The hallway then only continues on to [[Annabelle's Room]], no matter which side you leave from.

After exiting Annabelle's Room, the hall then leads to either the [[Sewers]] or the [[Roof Garden]].
