It is a simple room with beige patterned wallpaper and a large bed.  In the room there is a chest requiring a key. Inside the chest, it is full of paintings (or photographs if thatâ€™s cool) of little girls, just hundreds, maybe thousands. They all stretch across different time periods. 
	- With a thorough investigation, one can find a picture with a red circle around it of a girl with blond hair and green eyes. 
In the room is a vanity mirror, and when one does an arcana check, they can find that it is a portal to another realm. 
	- Attempting to enter would result in a level of madness.
A standing wardrobe contains nothing but human-length mirrors, on the inside walls and the inside of the doors. A character's reflection will be how Daewynn speaks to the character for a deal. Touching the mirror results in releasing a reflection, one of the souls trapped within the Manor's own demiplane.

On top of the bed, one could reach a handle leading to the attic.


A room within the [[Dealing Manor]]. Laying down in bed will send a character tumbling through space and landing in the [[Puzzle Room]], covered in sheets and lace, and partially undressed, a little joke of Daewynn's own design.
