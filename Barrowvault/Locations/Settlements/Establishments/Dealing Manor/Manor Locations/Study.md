The study is a small room absolutely torn up. It looks as if animals were let in and tore the place up. The sofa is ripped and the stuffing from the pillows lay about. All paintings in the room have tears that make them mangled and barely hanging to the frame. 
	- Some mending spells would reveal that it is family paintings, with the man and woman from the foyer paintings holding a small baby. 
	- In the desk, one would find a letter in an envelope, the edges burnt. The letter reads, “I appreciate hearing from you, Mykahni. It’s been two months since Wynrose died, and Sarah is not improving. She has gone mad with grief, for I see her talking to the walls themselves, begging for our daughter back. She claims there is something there, something I cannot see. It must be hysteria, but sometimes when I’m especially tired, I see a glimpse of black and white, creeping on the-” and the rest is torn off.

If the players make enough noise while searching through this room, or if they search through the pillows strewn around the floor, it will wake the family cat. This poor pet was experimented on by Agatha and it has since mutated into a beastly-looking grey-haired meenlock.

A room within the [[Dealing Manor]]. On the right side of the room stands a wooden display case with glass shelving and a mirror back. This stands upon a short set of wooden cabinets, which lead to the [[Hallway]] if crawled through. A door at the opposite wall from the entrance is blocked by a pile of pillows, under which lies a sleeping meenlock, as described above. This door leads to the [[Puzzle Room]].
