It is a typical child’s room with a small bed and stuffed animals everywhere, but a few notable items. There is a cat stuffed animal with the left eye ripped out and a dog stuffed animal hidden carefully under the bed. There is a small shelf with a few books, one notable one being Hansel and Gretel. 
	- Inside one of the pages is a note that reads “it gave me this book, does it want to eat me?” 
There is an art easel with some old paintings on it. 
	- There are some very beautiful ones signed by Wynrose Halifact. As the paintings are looked through, a noticeable drop in quality happens. The brush strokes are messy and unpracticed. 
	- On one painting, there is a signature crossed out and instead replaced with the signature of Wynrose Halifact, but the penmanship does not match. 
	- One last painting is found, a winding creature in black and white seen wrapping around cities, a face melting into its own spindly body. Written below is “it tells me to call it mother”




A room within the [[Dealing Manor]]. This room leads to another [[Hallway]], which can be seen partially by looking underneath Wynrose's bed.
