Far off to the left of the manor, in the foggy woods one may find a cellar door, seemingly randomly. Entering would reveal catacombs, dank and wet with the scent of mildew. Traversing through the catacombs would lead one into the foyer of the manor. In the catacombs, if one is perfectly perceptive, they may even catch a glimpse of a young girl with blonde hair and green eyes.

The entire sewer and pathway system beneath the manor is infested with shadows of souls captured by the owners of the Manor.

An area within the [[Dealing Manor]]. An exit leads to the [[Front Entrance]] and deeper in lies the [[Laboratory]].
