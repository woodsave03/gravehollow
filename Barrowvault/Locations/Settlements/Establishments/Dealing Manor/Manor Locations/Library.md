Upon arriving upstairs, the characters will be met with a vast maze of shelves. There are books on child raising, self help books, spell books, necromancy, magic of clerics, and a book simply titled “The Entity” (SEE LORE PAGE). There is a painting on the floor leaning up against the wall. On it is the picture of the man and woman from earlier paintings, as well as a young girl with blond hair and blue eyes. In her arms is a small kitten. 

A room within the [[Dealing Manor]]. There are 2 doors, each requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check, the left one leads to the [[Study]], and the back one leads to the [[Hallway]].
