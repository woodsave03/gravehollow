Upon entering the attic, one would find a wisp, the soul of a young girl. She will attack if touched or provoked, but can be won over persuasively by being reminded of her life as Wynrose Halifact. 
	- If given mercy, she will give details on the entity and some of Annabelleâ€™s life here in the manor.

This is the separated soul of who Annabelle used to be before being turned into a hag by Agatha. Annabelle does not recognize the name Wynrose Halifact and has forgotten her memories before the separation.

A room within the [[Dealing Manor]]. A circular window in the roof looks into a long [[Hallway]], which can be accessed through such.
