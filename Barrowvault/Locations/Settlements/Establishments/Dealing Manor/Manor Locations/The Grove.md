The room opens up to a natural cavern, several columns reach from the floor to ceiling, glistening black things that seem to pulse and contract every few seconds. The floor is covered in large piles of bramble, about 20 of them, with grey woody vines covered in thorns and adorned with a smattering of white leaves on each of the piles. After each contraction of the pillars, the brambles' leaves shudder, as if they were breathing. The room is alive with unnatural energy, and you intuitively recognize you are in the presence of an abhorrent mockery of life.

This is where Agatha once and Daewynn now grows their changelings, bred for infiltration and societal deadliness. The pillars are the influence of "the Entity," the being that holds Yphrhei hostage in the Feywild.

This area is a location in [[Dealing Manor]]. It can only be accessed through the [[Laboratory]].
