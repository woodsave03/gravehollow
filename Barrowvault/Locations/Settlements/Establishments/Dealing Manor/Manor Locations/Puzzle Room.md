A large room in the shape of a square, with a slightly lifted platform of a square. On the platform is a 3 by 3 grid made of weighted tiles. The pattern is as follows:

In the room, a strange heaviness lays in the air. There is something in the room that cannot be seen (I mean, like, the dc is a 25 for arcana or religion). It sees the adventurers though. Upon solving the puzzle correctly (Characters standing on the BLACK SUN, WHITE MOON, GREY CIRCLE, BLACK HOURGLASS), a countdown will occur throughout the room starting at 20. Upon running out of time, the door at the end of the room that was locked shut will open, revealing the way to the upper level.

A room within the [[Dealing Manor]]. After the puzzle is solved, the door's aura dissipates, and walking through will lead the characters to the [[Attic]].
