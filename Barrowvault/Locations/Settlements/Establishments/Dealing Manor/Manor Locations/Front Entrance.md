Renee Description: The manor is a looming, lonely vessel. The windows are all boarded up and the door is locked, albeit made of weak and molding wood. There are empty gardens, barren of any signs of life. All of it seems to have crawled up the manor itself, entwining itself with the wood and stone details. 

Any players that roll below a Quickling's intiative will be subjected to some possible theivery. 

A Nightstalker roams the woods outside.

An area within the [[Dealing Manor]]. This leads to the [[Foyer]], but there is also an entrance in the woods to the [[Sewers]].
