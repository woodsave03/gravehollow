- Renee Description: A large room in the shape of an octagon lies unassuming. Two staircases rise from either side of the entrance, leading to an overlooking balcony. There are torches on the walls burning an everlasting light, the green flames flickering as though alive themselves. Paintings line both levels, works of art displaying haughty and arrogant folks. A man with a long, twisted moustache smokes a cigar as he dully looks forward (Thomas Halifact). To his right is a woman with long blonde hair, smiling pointlessly forward, seeing past and maybe beyond (Sarah Halifact).  A few tables lay about along with a dusty old piano situated solemnly against the rightmost wall and the leftmost wall is covered by a bookshelf.
	- The bookshelf can be moved, revealing the entrance to the catacombs.
	- Behind one of the paintings is a phrase "Where the sun doesn't shine but the moon is bright, I see only grey as I run out of time."

A room within the [[Dealing Manor]]. A doorway in the center of the balcony leads to the [[Hallway]]. Doors underneath the balcony to the left and right lead to the [[Library]] and [[Dining Hall]], respectively.
