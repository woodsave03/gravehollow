>[!important]+ Location and Description
>A large coliseum located in the heart of the city, with large archways allowing hoards of spectators to enter through. Detailed stone work can be found on every wall and column, evoking ancient draconic imagery. The arena itself hosts rows upon rows of seating, enough to host thousands of attendants. High up there are various guest boxes reserved for the most wealthy members of draconic society. An announcer's box is amongst these, magically equipped to allow the users voice to be heard amongst the roaring crowds. 
>
>At the center of this massive coliseum is a large circular arena with a sandy floor. Four bared entrances lead into the fighting pit, a large moat circling it, with draconic fountains jutting out of the walls. Small bridges with snake head railings allow the competitors passage to the center of the arena. Twelve fifty foot columns of rough stone topped with fire line up around the arena. Large stone crocodile statues, standing rearing on their hide quarters, provide platforms for competitors to take their starting positions on.
