>[!danger]- **Vethiskaar the Last** _(d. 1354)_
>The final emperor of the Arcane Draconic Empire, Vethiskaar attempted to extend his dominion by manipulating the Fabric to control elemental forces. This catastrophic experiment led to the collapse of his empire and the onset of the elemental storms that defined the Tenechron. His name is now synonymous with hubris among arcane scholars.
