>[!important]+ Location and Description
>Located in the fallen ruins of a draconic city from the Age of Arcanum, this mountain-road outpost in the Drakonspyre Mountain range is filled with all sorts of refugees from the law and ne're-do-wells. there is definitely a thieves guild. the leader is the person who last stole a covetted Age of Arcanum artifact. thus the leader changes often in a city of thieves and conniving merchants. because of the nature of its populace, this is known as The Uncharted City (no maps allowed) to safeguard the residents. although those two rules (ruler and antimaps) are basically the only limitations.
